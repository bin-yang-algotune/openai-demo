{"prompt":"Have you ever bought a company where the numbers told you not to? How much is quantitative and how much is qualitative? ->","completion":" The best buys have been when the numbers almost tell you not to. Because then you feel so strongly about the product. And not just the fact you are getting a used cigar butt cheap. Then it is compelling. I owned a windmill company at one time. Windmills are cigar butts, believe me. I bought it very cheap, I bought it at a third of working capital. And we made money out of it, but there is no repetitive money to be made on it. There is a one-time profit in something like that. And it is just not the thing to be doing. I went through that phase. I bought streetcar companies and all kinds of things. In terms of the qualitative, I probably understand the qualitative the moment I get the phone call. Almost every business we have bought has taken five or ten minutes in terms of analysis. We bought two businesses this year.\nGeneral Re is a $18 billion deal. I have never been to their home office. I hope it is there. (Laughter) âThere could be a few guys there saying what numbers should we send Buffett this month?â I could see them going once a month and saying we have $20 billion in the bank instead of $18 billion.\tI have never been there.\nBefore I bought Executive Jet, which is fractional ownership of jets, before I bought it, I had never been there. I bought my family a quarter interest in the program three years earlier. And I have seen the service and it seems to develop well. And I got the numbers. But if you donât know enough to know about the business instantly, you wonât know enough in a month or in two months. You have to have sort of the background of understanding and knowing what you do or donât understand. That is the key. It is defining your circle of competence.\nEverybody has got a different circle of competence. The important thing is not how big the circle is, the important thing is the size of the circle; the important thing is staying inside the circle. And if that circle only has 30 companies in it out of 1000s on the big board, as long as you know which 30 they are, you will be OK. And you should know those businesses well enough so you donât need to read lots of work. Now I did a lot of work in the earlier years just getting familiar with businesses and the way I would do that is use what Phil Fisher would call, the âScuttlebutt Approach.â I would go out and talk to customers, suppliers, and maybe ex-employees in some cases. Everybody. Everytime I was interested in an industry, say it was coal, I would go around and see every coal company. I would ask every CEO, âIf you could only buy stock in one coal company that was not your own, which one would it be and why? You piece those things together, you learn about the business after awhile.\nFunny, you get very similar answers as long as you ask about competitors. If you had a silver bullet and you could put it through the head of one competitor, which competitor and why? You will find who the best guy is in the industry. So there are a lot of things you can learn about a business. I have done that in the past on the business I felt I could understand so I donât have to do that anymore. The nice thing about investing is that you donât have to learn anything new. You can do it if you want to, but if you learn Wrigleyâs chewing gum forty years ago, you still understand Wrigleyâs chewing gum. There are not a lot of great insights to get of the sort as you go along. So you do get a database in your head.\nI had a guy, Frank Rooney, who ran Melville for many years; his father-in-law died and had owned H.H. Brown, a shoe company. And he put it up with Goldman Sachs. But he was playing golf with a friend of mine here in Florida and he mentioned it to this friend, so my friend said âWhy donât you call Warren?â He called me after the match and in five minutes I basically had a deal.\nBut I knew Frank, and I knew the business. I sort of knew the basic economics of the shoe business, so I could buy it. Quantitatively, I have to decide what the price is. But, you know, that is either yes or no. I donât fool a lot around with negotiations. If they name a price that makes sense to me, I buy it. If they donât, I was happy the day before, so I will be happy the day after without owning it.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What is it that really piques your interest in a stock? What tells you that it could be interesting? ->","completion":" We're so limited now because we can only go into very big companies. Charlie and I are probably familiar with every company in the United States--in a general way--that we can have the kind of position we would need to have [to make a difference in Berkshire Hathaway's performance]. We look for the ones where we think we know what they're going to look like in 10 years. If the price gets attractive and we know a little about the management, and we're quite sure--within a range--what they're going to look like in 10 years, we're in our area. We buy them when the prices are right, like Coca-Cola was some years back.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What is your investment process? ->","completion":" \n\n"}
{"prompt":"What's your acquisition criteria? What has made you successful in this area where most others have failed? ->","completion":" We look for people who have a passion for their business. We frequently buy businesses the owners still manage, where they are monetizing a lifetime of work. They often donât want to sell but need to for estate planning or other reasons.\nThey need to have a passion because we donât have any employment contracts â because we donât think they work â we donât stand over them with whips, and theyâre already rich. We just try not to kill or dampen their love for their business.\nWe also look for three things: intelligence, energy and integrity. If you donât have the latter, then you should hope they donât have the first two either. If someone doesnât have integrity, then you want them to be dumb and lazy. (Laughter)\nWe look them in the eyes and ask, âDo they love the business or the money?â If someone wants to cash out, then we have a problem because we only have 16 people at Berkshireâs headquarters and canât run it ourselves.\nMunger: The interesting thing is how well it [our acquisition strategy\/process] has worked over a great many decades, and how few people copy it. (Laughter)\nWe criticize it [acquisitions], but then we do it. But we have different motivations.\nWeâve been reasonably successful in having people run their businesses with the same passion as before we bought them.\nGillette, the oil companies, etc. all went out and bought a lot of businesses and tried to run them themselves. Weâre under no illusions that we can do that. We think that having lots of Executive Vice Presidents, directives from headquarters, centralized Human Resources etc. can destroy the incentives of the people whoâve already gotten rich, and weâre counting on them making us rich.\nThe successor to me will come from Berkshire, knows our system, has seen that it works, and will be surrounded by people who believe in it. So itâs not going to be so hard to keep this train going down the tracks at 90 miles per hour.\n[CM: Our success has come from the lack of oversight weâve provided, and our success will continue to be from a lack of oversight. (Laughter)\nBut if youâre going to provide minimal oversight, you have to buy carefully. Itâs a different model from GEâs. GEâs works â itâs just very different from ours.]\nWe are a conglomerate â and we hope to become more of a conglomerate.\nWeâre successful because of simplicity itself: We let people who play the game very well keep doing it. Our successor wonât change this. The big worry is that the culture is tampered with and thereâs oversteering. But our board and owners wonât allow this.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What's your acquisition strategy? How do you get deals? ->","completion":" We'd like to keep buying businesses like the eight we bought last year. Our first preference has always been to buy outstanding operating businesses outright. We've made money in stocks, especially in the 1970s, but the climate is not so favorable now.\nThere are enough businesses that meet our criteria to do two acquisitions per year on average. What we'd really like to do is a $10-15 billion acquisition, but it's hard to find one that's not being auctioned, which we don't do.\nWe haven't had much luck buying businesses overseas, but that's because our phone hasn't rung. We're not on the radar screen, but we're hoping this will change.\nOur best source of deals is word of mouth, generally in industries we're invested in. Sort of like NetJets, where 70% of our new customers are referred by current customers.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Deal Flow? ->","completion":" We don't like the term \"deal flow\" because we don't view them [businesses we might buy] as deals. We look at deals a few times a year. In the US, we get a pretty reasonable percentage of the calls we should get. We didn't get those calls 20-40 years ago because we weren't as well known.\nIt feeds on itself. If we acquire companies and people say good things, we'll hear from more. We acquired one furniture company, which led to four more.\nIt's like a snowball. By being around 38 years, it's been a high mountain [and Berkshire is now a] big snowball and attracts a lot of snow.\nOutside the US, we don't see many deals because we're not as well known.\nI don't hear about one [deal] a week or even a month. But most we want to hear about, we get a good percentage of the calls. It would be a plus [if we were to see more deals] outside this country.\n[CM: The general assumption is that it must be easy to sit behind a desk and people will bring in one good opportunity after another -- this was the attitude in venture capital until a few years ago. This was not the case at all for us -- we scrounged around for companies to buy. For 20 years, we didn't buy more than one or two per year.]\n\t\t\t\t\nWe didn't have the money to do many deals. When we bought National Indemnity, it was a big deal for us. We hope there's a lot of mountain left and a lot of wet snow.\n\n"}
{"prompt":"What sources of investment ideas are available today?  ->","completion":" First, you need two piles. You have to segregate businesses you can understand and reasonably predict from those you don't understand and can't reasonably predict. An example is chewing gum versus software. You also have to recognize what you can and cannot know. Put everything you can't understand or that is difficult to predict in one pile. That is the too-hard pile. Once you know the other pile, then it's important to read a lot, learn about the industries, get background information, etc. on the companies in those piles. Read a lot of 10Ks and Qs, etc. Read about the competitors. I don't want to know the price of the stock prior to my analysis. I want to do the work and estimate a value for the stock and then compare that to the current offering price. If I know the price in advance it may influence my analysis. We're getting ready to make a $5 billion investment and this was the process I used.\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you have any investing tips? ->","completion":" \n\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you build your investment knowledge? ->","completion":" We read a lot: daily publications, annual reports, 10Ks, 10Qs, business magazines, etc.\nFortunately, the investment business is one where knowledge accumulates and builds into a knowledge base that's useful. There's a lot to absorb over time. 40-50 years ago, I visited a lot of companies, but haven't done this in a long, long time.\n[CM: The more basic knowledge you have, the less new knowledge you have to get. The guy who plays chess blindfolded [a chess master comes to Omaha during Berkshire's annual meeting weekend and, in an exhibition, plays multiple players blindfolded] -- he has a knowledge of the board, which allows him to do this.\nI'd hate to give up The Wall Street Journal.]\nYou'd also hate to give up the Buffalo News [which Berkshire owns]. [Laughter.] You want to read a lot of financial publications. The New York Times has a much better business section than it had 25 years ago. Read Fortune.\nI don't read any analyst reports. If I read one, it's because the funny pages weren't available. I don't know why anyone does it.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Is there an organizational model that allows you to deal with all the information? ->","completion":" The beauty of valuing large companies is that it is cumulative. If you started doing it 40 or so years ago, you've really got a working knowledge of an awful lot of businesses. There aren't that many, to start with. What are there, 75 or so important industries? You get to understand how they all operate, and you don't have to start over again every day, and you don't have to consult a computer or anything like that. So, it has the advantage of the accumulation of useful information over time. Why did we decide to buy Coca-Cola in 1988? Well, it may have been because of a couple of small, incremental bits of information, but that came into a mass that had been accumulated over decades. That's why we like businesses that don't change very much.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you have advice for the individual investor to help them narrow the stock universe? ->","completion":" They ought to think about what he or she understands. Let's just say they were going to put their whole family's net worth in a single business. Would that be a business they would consider? Or would they say, \"Gee, I don't know enough about that business to go into it?\" If so, they should go on to something else. It's buying a piece of a business. If they were going to buy into a local service station or convenience store, what would they think about? They would think about the competition, the competitive position both of the industry and the specific location, the person they have running it and all that. There are all kinds of businesses that Charlie and I don't understand, but that doesn't cause us to stay up at night. It just means we go on to the next one, and that's what the individual investor should do.\nSo if they're walking through the mall and they see a store they like, or if they happen to like Nike shoes for example, these would be great places to start? Instead of doing a computer screen and narrowing it down?\nA computer screen doesn't tell you anything. It might tell you about P\/Es or something like that, but in the end you have to understand the business. If there are certain businesses in that mall they think they understand and they're public companies, and they can learn more and more about them.... We used to talk to competitors. To understand Coca-Cola, I have to understand Pepsi, RC, Dr. Pepper.\n[CM: And Cott. Cott is the one you have to understand more than anything else. [Note: Cott is a Canadian company specializing on low-priced, private-label soft drinks.]]\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What advice would you give to new investors? ->","completion":" I think you should read everything you can. In my case, by the age of 10, Iâd read every book in the Omaha public library about investing, some twice. You need to fill your mind with various competing thoughts and decide which make sense. Then you have to jump in the water â take a small amount of money and do it yourself. Investing on paper is like reading a romance novel vs. doing something else. [Laughter] Youâll soon find out whether you like it. The earlier you start, the better.\nAt age 19, I read a book [The Intelligent Investor] and what Iâm doing today, at age 76, is running things through the same thought process I learned from the book I read at 19.\nI remain big on reading everything in sight. And when you get the opportunity to meet someone like Lorimer Davidson, as I did, jump at it. I probably learned more in that four hours than in almost any course in college or business school.\nMunger: Sandy Gottesman, a Berkshire director, runs a large, successful investment firm. Notice his employment practices. When he interviews someone, he asks: âWhat do you own and why do you own it?â If youâre not interested enough to own something, then heâd tell you to find something else to do.\nBuffett: Charlie and I have made money in a lot of different ways, some of which we didnât anticipate 30-40 years ago. You canât have a defined roadmap, but you can have a reservoir of thinking, looking at markets in different places, different securities, etc. The key is that we knew what we didnât know. We just kept looking. We knew during the Long Term Capital Management crisis that there would be a lot of opportunities, so we just had to read and think eight to ten hours a day. We needed a reservoir of experience. We wonât spot every one, though â weâve missed all kinds of things.\nBut you need something in the way youâre programmed so you donât lose a lot of money. Our best ideas havenât done better than othersâ best ideas, but weâve lost less. Weâve never gone two steps forward and then one step back â maybe just a fraction of a step back.\nMunger: And of course the place to look when youâre young is the inefficient markets. You shouldnât be trying to guess if one drug company is going to have a better pipeline than another.\nBuffett: You should do well in games with few other players. The RTC [Resolution Trust Corporation] was a great example of a chance to make a lot of money. Here was a seller [government bureaucrats] with hundreds of billions of dollars of real estate and no money in the game, who wanted to wrap up quickly, while many buyers had no money and had been burned.\nThere wonât be any scarcity of opportunity in your life, although there will be times when you feel that way.\n"}

{"prompt":"Where is a good place for new investors to invest right now? ->","completion":" ThatÂâs very difficult - we donÂât have one-line advice on that. Maybe for a small investor, continuous investment in index funds might work - but not for us. I like the businesses weÂâre in, so I wouldnÂât be giving up any of my businesses.\nInvestors have to remember: corporate profits are going up, but stocks are going up faster. How can that continue indefinitely? Investors can only earn what companies themselves can earn; the government or the markets themselves donÂât kick anything in. How can you get anything more out of a farm than what it grows?\nThereÂâs nothing magical added by the stock market to corporate returns. It just doesnÂât create more earnings to pay out to investors. If you trace out the mathematics of the marketÂâs logic, you begin to see the limits to the logic.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Are investors more or less knowledgeable today compared to ten years ago? ->","completion":" There is no doubt that there are far more âinvestment professionalsâ and way more IQ in the field, as it didn't use to look that promising. Investment data are available more conveniently and faster today. But the behavior of investors will not be more intelligent than in the past, despite all this. How people react will not change â their psychological makeup stays constant. You need to divorce your mind from the crowd. The herd mentality causes all these IQ's to become paralyzed. I don't think investors are now acting more intelligently, despite the intelligence. Smart doesn't always equal rational. To be a successful investor you must divorce yourself from the fears and greed of the people around you, although it is almost impossible.\nDo you think Ponzi was crazy? The tech and telecom madness that existed just 6 years ago is right up there with the craziest mania's that have ever happened. Huge training in capital management didn't help.\nTake Long Term Capital Management. They had 100's of millions of their own money, and had all of that experience. The list included Nobel Prize winners. They probably had the highest IQ of any 100 people working together in the country, yet the place still blew up. It went to zero in a matter of days.

I guarantee that.]\n\t\t\t\t\n[At a talk to Columbia students in 1993 you shared:\nWhen I got out of Columbia the first place I went to work was a five-person brokerage firm with operations in Omaha. It subscribed to Moody's industrial manual, banks and finance manual and public utilities manual. I went through all those page by page.\nI found a little company called Genesee Valley Gas near Rochester . It had 22,000 shares out. It was a public utility that was earning about $5 per share, and the nice thing about it was you could buy it at $5 per share.\nI found Western Insurance in Fort Scott, Kansas. The price range in Moody's financial manual...was $12-$20. Earnings were $16 a share. I ran an ad in the Fort Scott paper to buy that stock.\nI found the Union Street Railway, in New Bedford, a bus company. At that time it was selling at about $45 and, as I remember, had $120 a share in cash and no liabilities.]\n[Along similar lines, in late 2005 I understand you explained to a group of Harvard students the following:\nCiticorp sent a manual on Korean stocks. Within 5 or 6 hours, twenty stocks selling at 2 or 3x earnings with strong balance sheets were identified.\tKorea rebuilt itself in a big way post 1998. Companies overbuilt their balance sheets Ââ including Daehan Flour Mill with 15,000 won\/year earning power and selling at Ââ2 and changeÂâ times earnings.\tThe strategy was to buy the securities of twenty companies thereby spreading the risk that some of the companies will be run by crooks. $100 million was quickly put to work.]\n[The Ââ1987Ââ Fisher Approach -The following excerpts from an article written by Carol Loomis published on April 11, 1988 in Fortune provide interesting clarity on the modus-operandi of Berkshire circa 1987:\nUnusual Profitability (High ROE with Low Debt; i.e. high ROIC) -\t\nâ¦But in his 1987 annual report, Buffett the businessman comes out of the closet to point out just how good these enterprises and their managers are. Had the Sainted Seven operated as a single business in 1987, he says, they would have employed $175 million in equity capital, paid only a net $2 million in interest, and earned, after taxes, $100 million. That's a return on equity of 57%, and it is exceptional. As Buffett says, ''You'll seldom see such a percentage anywhere, let alone at large, diversified companies with nominal leverage.''\nUnusual Growth (Opportunities for Reinvestment of Retained Earnings) - \t\nâ¦Some folks of the right sort, by the name of Heldman, read that ad and brought him their uniform business, Fechheimer, in 1986. The business had only about $6 million in profits, which is an operation smaller than Buffett thinks ideal. \t\nâ¦A few hundred miles away at Fechheimer (\nâ¦1987 sales: $75 million)\nPaying for Quality - \nâ¦By 1972, Blue Chip Stamps, a Berkshire affiliate that has since been merged into the parent, was paying three times book value to buy See's Candies, and the good-business era was launched. ''I have been shaped tremendously by Charlie,'' says Buffett. ''Boy, if I had listened only to Ben, would I ever be a lot poorer.]\n"}

You are underestimating quality. We listened to the criticism and changed our mind. This is a good lesson for anyone: the ability to take criticism constructively and learn from it. If you take the indirect lessons we learned from See's, you could say Berkshire was built on constructive criticism. Now we don't want any more today. [Laughter]]\nThe qualitative [evaluating management, competitive advantage, etc.] is harder to teach and understand, so why not just focus on the quantitative [e.g., cigar butt investing]? Charlie emphasized quality [of a business] much more than I did initially. He had a different background.\nIt makes more sense to buy a wonderful business at a fair price. We've changed over the years in this direction. It's not hard to watch businesses over 50 years and learn where the big money can be made.\nEven when you get a new important idea, the old ideas are still there. There wasn't a strong line of demarcation when we moved from cigar butts to wonderful businesses. But over time, we moved.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}

{"prompt":"According to a business week report published in 1999, you were quoted as saying âit's a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.â First, would you say the same thing today? Second, since that statement infers that you would invest in smaller companies, other than investing in small-caps, what else would you do differently? ->","completion":" Yes, I would still say the same thing today. In fact, we are still earning those types of returns on some of our smaller investments. The best decade was the 1950s; I was earning 50% plus returns with small amounts of capital. I could do the same thing today with smaller amounts. It would perhaps even be easier to make that much money in today's environment because information is easier to access.\nYou have to turn over a lot of rocks to find those little anomalies. You have to find the companies that are off the map - way off the map. You may find local companies that have nothing wrong with them at all. A company that I found, Western Insurance Securities, was trading for $3\/share when it was earning $20\/share!! I tried to buy up as much of it as possible. No one will tell you about these businesses. You have to find them.\nOther examples: Genesee Valley Gas, public utility trading at a P\/E of 2, GEICO, Union Street Railway of New Bedford selling at $30 when $100\/share is sitting in cash, high yield position in 2002. No one will tell you about these ideas, you have to find them.\nThe answer is still yes today that you can still earn extraordinary returns on smaller amounts of capital. For example, I wouldn't have had to buy issue after issue of different high yield bonds. Having a lot of money to invest forced Berkshire to buy those that were less attractive. With less capital, I could have put all my money into the most attractive issues and really creamed it.\nI know more about business and investing today, but my returns have continued to decline since the 50's. Money gets to be an anchor on performance. At Berkshire's size, there would be no more than 200 common stocks in the world that we could invest in if we were running a mutual fund or some other kind of investment business.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you believe that we'll have significant mispricings again? And if you were 26 today how would you generate the 50% returns that you said you might do with smaller amounts of capital? ->","completion":" Attractive opportunities come from observing human behavior. In 1998, people behaved like frightened cavemen (referring to the Long Term Capital Management meltdown). People make their own opportunities. They will be frozen by fear, excited by greed and it doesnât matter what their IQ, degrees etc is. Growth of 50% per year is with small capitalization, not large cap. The point is I got rich looking for stock with strong earnings.\nThe last 50 years werenât unique. Itâs just capitalizing on human behavior. Itâs people that make opportunities when others are frozen by fear or excited by greed. Human behavior allows for success if you are able to detach yourself emotionally.\nIn 1951, I got out of school at 20 years old. At the time there were two publishers of stock information, Moodyâs and Standards and Poorâs. I used Moodyâs and went through every manual. I recently bought a copy of the 1951 Moody off of Amazon. On page 1433, thereâs a stock you could have made some money on. The EPS was $29 and the Price Range was from $3-$21\/share. On another page, there is a company that had an EPS of $29.5 and the price range was $27-28, 1x earnings. You can get rich finding things like this, things that arenât written about.\nA couple of years ago I got this investment guide on Korean stocks. I began looking through it. It felt like 1974 all over again. Look here at this company...Dae Han, I don't know how you pronounce it, itâs a flour company. It earned 12,879 won previously. It currently had a book value of 200,000 won and was earning 18,000 won. It had traded as high as 43,000 and as low as 35,000 won. At the time, the current price was 40,000 or 2 times earnings. In 4 hours I had found 20 companies like this.\nThe point is nobody is going to tell you about these companies. There are no broker reports on Dae Han Flour Company. When you invest like this, you will make money. Sure 1 or 2 companies may turn out to be poor choices, but the others will more than make up for any losses. Not all of them will be good, but some will and those will make you rich. And this didnât happen in 1932, this was in 2004! These opportunities will be there in the next 30 years. Youâll have streaks where youâll find some bad companies and a few times where youâll make money with everything that you do.\nThe Wall Street analysts are brilliant people; they are better at math, but we know more about human nature.\nIn your investing life you will have several opportunities and one or two that canât go wrong. For example, in 1998 the NY fed offered a 30-year treasury bonds yielding less then the 29-Â½ year treasury bonds by 30 basis points. What happened was LTCM put a trade on at 10 basis points and it was a crowded trade, they were 100% certain to make money but they could not afford any hiccups. I know more about human nature; these were MIT grads, really smart guys, and they almost toppled the system with their highly leveraged trading.\nThis was definitely a good time to act.\n"}
{"prompt":"You have often spoken of the difficulties of compounding large sums of money. But in an article I read, you were quoted as saying that you think you could compound 50% returns on small sums of money, say $1 million. Where could you find those kind of investments in todayÂâs market? ->","completion":" I was misquoted in that article. I get together with about 60 people every couple years and get their expectations of returns. Of those investors, I think thereâs a half dozen who could get those kinds of returns - but theyâre only going to find those returns in small places.\nI stumble onto those things occasionally but Iâm not looking for them. Iâm looking for things that Berkshire Hathaway can do.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Could you describe the capital allocation process you follow? How do you determine the charges for capital to your different managers? ->","completion":" There is no better way to make managers understand how valuable capital is than to charge them for it. The amount charged to them can depend on elements such as the history of the subsidiary and the level of interest rates, and has varied from 14 to 20 percent at times. The important thing, Buffett emphasized, is that âwe donât want managers to think of other peopleÂâs money as âfree\" money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What filters do you use when looking at companies? ->","completion":" [CM: Well, opportunity cost is a huge filter in life. If you've got two suitors who are eager to have you, but one is way better than the other, you're going to choose that one rather than the other. That's the way we filter stock buying opportunities. Our ideas are so simple. People keep asking us for mysteries, but all we have are the most elementary ideas.]\nWe know instantly whether a business is something we're going to understand, and whether it's a business that's going to have a sustainable edge, and that gets rid of a very significant percentage of opportunities. I'm sure people regard me and Charlie as very arbitrary--in the middle of the first sentence, we'll say, \"We appreciate the call, but we're not interested.\" I'm sure that if they explain something I might get buttered on it, but we really can tell in the middle of the first sentence whether those two factors exist ... We can sometimes tell by who we're dealing with, whether a deal is ever going to work out or not. I mean, if there's an auction going on, we have no interest in talking about it. If someone is interested in doing that with their business, then they're going to want to sit down and renegotiate everything with us all over again after the deal is done ...We don't want to listen to stories all day, and we don't need brokerage reports. There's other things to do with your time.\n[CM: Another filter is the concept of the quality person, which most people define as someone very much like themselves. (laughter) There are so many wonderful people out there, and there are so many awful people out there. And there are signs, like flags, waving over the awful people. And generally speaking, those people are to be avoided.]\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"How would you recommend an individual investor who follows the Graham and Dodd philosophy to allocate their capital today? ->","completion":" Well, it depends whether they are going to be an active investor.  Graham distinguished between the defensive and the enterprising and that.  So if you are going to spend a lot of time on investment, you know I just advise looking at as many things as possible and you will find some bargains.  And when you find them, you have to act.  It doesn't -- it hasn't changed at all since I was here in 1950, 1951.  And it won't change the rest of my life.  You start turning pages.  When I got out of school, I turned every page in Moody's 10,000-some pages twice, looking for companies.  And you have to find them yourself.  The world isn't going to tell you about great deals.  You have to find them yourself.  And that takes a fair amount of time.  So if you are not going to do that, if you are just going to be a passive investor, then I just advise an index fund more consistently over a long period of time.   The one thing I will tell you is the worst investment you can have is cash.  Everybody is talking about cash being king and all that sort of thing.  Most of you don't look like you are overburdened with cash anyway. Cash is going to become worth less over time.  But good businesses are going to become worth more over time.  And you don't want to pay too much for them so you have to have some discipline about what you pay.  But the thing to do is find a good business and stick with it.\n\t\t\t\t\n[Becky - Does that mean you think we are through the roughest times?  You had always kept the cash word around, too.]\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWe always keep enough cash around so I feel very comfortable and don't worry about sleeping at night.  But it's not because I like cash as an investment.  Cash is a bad investment over time.  But you always want to have enough so that nobody else can determine your future essentially.  The worst -- the financial panic is behind us.  The economic spillout which came to some extent from that financial panic is still with us.  It will end.  I don't know if it will end tomorrow or next week or next month.  Or maybe a year.  But it won't go on forever.  And to sit around and try and pick the bottom, people were trying to do that last March and the bottom hadn't come in unemployment and the bottom hadn't come in business but the bottom had come in stocks.  Don't pass up something that's attractive today because you think you will find something way more attractive tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":"What impacts have Graham\/Dodd and Phil Fisher had on your investment philosophy? What percentage of your investment philosophy would you attribute to each of them? ->","completion":" Well, good things would have happened with following either party. Graham obviously had more influence on me than Phil. I worked for Ben, I went to school under him, and his three basic ideas: look at stocks as businesses; have a proper attitude toward the market; and operate with a margin of safety--they all come straight from Graham. Phil Fisher opened my eyes a little more toward trying to find a wonderful business. Charlie did more of that than Phil did, but Phil was espousing that entirely, and I read his books in the early 60s. Phil's still alive, and I owe Phil a lot, but Ben was one of a kind.\n[CM:  Ben Graham was a truly formidable mind, and he also had a clarity in writing, and we talk over and over again about the power of a few simple ideas thoroughly assimilated, and that happened with Graham's ideas which came to me indirectly through Warren, but some also directly from Graham. The interesting thing for me is that Buffett the former protÃ©gÃ©--by the way Buffett was the best student Graham had in 30 years of teaching at Columbia--became better than Graham. That's the natural outcome--as Milton said, \"If I've seen a little farther than other men, it's by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" So, Warren stood on Ben's shoulders, but he ended up seeing more than Ben. No doubt somebody will come along and do a lot better than we have.]\n\t\t\t\t\nI enjoyed making money more than Ben. With Ben it really was incidental, at least by the time I knew him. The process, the whole game, didn't interest him more than a dozen other things may have interested him. With me, I just find it interesting, and therefore I've spent a much higher percentage of my timing thinking about investing, and thinking about businesses. I probably know way more about businesses than Ben ever did. He had other things that interested him. I pursued the game quite a bit differently than he did, and therefore comparing the record is not proper.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Since Ben Graham isn't around anymore, what money managers do you respect today? Is there a Ben Graham today? ->","completion":" You don't need another Ben Graham. You don't need another Moses. There were only Ten Commandments; we're still waiting for the eleventh. His investing philosophy is still alive and well. There are disciples of him around, but all we are doing is parroting. I did read Phil Fisher later on, which showed the more qualitative aspects of businesses. Common stocks are part of a business. Markets are there to serve you, not to instruct you. You can often find a couple of companies that are out of line. Find one; get rich. Most people think that what the stock does from day to day contains information, but it doesn't. It isn't just something that wiggles around. The stock market is the best game in the world. You can take advantage of people who have no morals. High prices inside of a year will typically be 100% of the low price. Businesses don't change in value that much. That is simply crazy. There are extreme degrees of fluctuation, and Mr. Market will call out the prices. Wait until he is nutty in one direction or the other. Put in a margin of safety. Don't find a bridge that says no more than 10,000 pounds when you have a 9800 pound vehicle. It isn't a function of IQ, but receptivity of the mind.\nWhen investing you don't have to invest in all 10,000 companies available, you just have to find the one that is out of line. Mr. Market is your servant. Mr. Market is your partner and wants to sell the business to you everyday. Some days he is very optimistic and wants a high price, others he is pessimistic and will sell at a low price. You have to use this to your advantage. The market is the greatest game in the world. There is nothing else that can, at times, get this far out of line with reality. For example, land usually only fluctuates within a 15% band. Negotiated transactions are less volatile. Some get this; others don't. Just keep your wits about you and you can make a lot of money in the market.\n"}
{"prompt":"If you were to teach an investment course, besides works by Ben Graham and Phil Fisher and your book on the instalment basis, what would be on the syllabus? ->","completion":" [Q - how would you teach the next generation of investors?]\nBuffett: I had 49 university groups, in clumps of six, [visit me] last year. [An education in] investing requires only two courses: How to Value a Business, and How to Think About Markets. You donât have to know how to value all businesses. Start with a small circle of competence, things you can understand. [Look for] things that are selling for less than theyâre worth. Forget about things you canât understand. You need to understand accounting, which has enormous limitations. [You need to] understand when a competitive advantage is durable or fleeting. Learn that the market is there to serve you, not instruct you. In the investing business, if you have an IQ of 150, sell 30 points to someone else. You do not need to be a genius. You need to have emotional stability, inner peace and be able to think for yourself, [since] youâre subjected to all sorts of stimuli. Itâs not a complicated game; you donât need to understand math. Itâs simple, but not easy.\nMunger: Exactly half of future investors are going to be in the bottom 50%. There is so much thatâs false and nutty in business schools. Reducing the nonsense would be a good goal.\nBuffett: Emotional makeup is more important than technical skill.\nMunger: Absolutely. If you think your IQ is 160 and itâs really 150, youâre a\n\t\t\t\tdisaster.\nBuffett: A student in one of the groups asked me, âWhat are we learning thatâs wrong?â\nMunger: How do you answer in only one hour? [laughter]\nBuffett: [My experience] has given me a jaundiced view of academia generally. Efficient market theoryâthat everything is priced appropriatelyâis bunk. Thereâs a certain degree to which ideas that are nutty take hold and propagate. Max Planck [remarked about] the resistance of the human mind to new ideas: âScience advances one funeral at a time.â\n[CM: I think there's something to be said for developing the disposition to own stocks without fretting.]\nI think it's almost impossible to do well investing over time without this. If the market closed for years, we wouldn't care. Would still keep making Sees candy, Dilly bars, etc.\nIf you focus on the price, you're assuming that the market knows more than you do. That may be the truth, but in that case you shouldn't own it. The stock market is there to serve you, not to instruct you.\nFocus on price and value. If a stock gets cheaper and you have some cash, buy more. We sometimes stop buying when prices goes up. This cost us $8 billion a few years ago when we were buying Wal-Mart. When we're buying something, we want the price to go down and down and down.\nYou don't have to be right on everything or 20%, 10%, or 5% of businesses. You only have to be right one or two times a year. I used to handicap horses. You can come up with a very profitable decision on a single company. If someone asked me to handicap the 500 companies in the S&P 500, I wouldn't do a very good job. You only have to be right a few times in your lifetime, as long as you don't make any big mistakes.\n[CM: What's funny is that most big investment organizations don't think like this. They hire lots of people, evaluate Merck vs. Pfizer and every stock in the S&P 500, and think they can beat the market. You can't do it. Very few people have adopted our approach.]\nTed Williams, in his book The Science of Hitting, talked about how he carved up the strike zone into different zones and only swung at pitches that were in his sweet spot.

There could be something that happens by I think the chances are almost nil. So what we really want to do is buy businesses that we would be happy to own forever. It is the same way I fell about people who buy Berkshire. I want people who buy Berkshire to plan to hold it forever. They may not for one reason or the other but I want them at the time they buy it to think they are buying a business they are going to want to own forever.\nAnd I donât say that is the only way to buy things. It is just the group to join me because I donât want to have a changing group all the time.\tI measure Berkshire by how little activity there is in it. If I had a church and I was the preacher and half the congregation left every Sunday. I wouldnât say, âIt is marvelous to have all this liquidity among my members.â\nTerrific turnover... I would rather go to church where all the seats are filled every Sunday by the same people. Well that is the way we look at the businesses we buy. We want to buy something virtually forever. And we canât find a lot of those. And back when I started, I had way more ideas than money so I was just constantly having to sell what was the least attractive stock in order to buy something I just discovered that looked even cheaper. But that is not our problem really now. So we hope we are buying businesses that we are just as happy holding five years from now as now. And if we ever found a huge acquisition, then maybe we would have to sell something. Maybe to make that acquisition but that would be a very pleasant problem to have.\nWe never buy something with a price target in mind. We never buy something at 30 saying if it goes to 40 weâll sell it or 50 or 60 or 100. We just donât do it that way. Anymore than when we buy a private business like Seeâs Candy for $25 million. We donât ever say if we ever get an offer of $50 million for this business we will sell it. That is not the way to look at a business.\nThe way to look at a business is this going to keep producing more and more money over time? And if the answer to that is yes, you donât need to ask any more questions.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Could you explain more about the circle of competence? ->","completion":" We are best at evaluating businesses where we can come to a judgment that they will look a lot like they do now in five years. The businesses will change, but the fundamentals wonât. Iscar will be better â maybe a lot bigger â in five years, but the fundamentals will be the same. [In contrast,] look at how much telecom has changed.\nCharlie says we have three boxes: In, Out and Too Hard. You donât have to do everything well. At the Olympics, if you run the 100 meters well, you donât have to do the shot put.\nTom Watson [the founder of IBM] said, âIâm no genius. Iâm smart in spots and I stay around those spots.â We have a lot of managers who are the same.

Some businesses are very, very hard to predict.\n[CM: A foreign correspondent, after talking to me for a while, once said: âYou donât seem smart enough to be so good at what youâre doing. Do you have an explanation?â [Laughter]]\nBuffett: Was he referring to me or you?

{"prompt":"What two industries are the first you should learn when developing your circle of competence? ->","completion":" Look for simple businesses. If I gave you $10M to invest right now and you only had three weeks to spend it and you could only spend it in Omaha, youâd look for simple, understandable, strong businesses. You look at the Nebraska Furniture Mart (NFM). You wouldnât look at the third best fast food chain. You might look at McDonaldâs, because it is number one and will probably always been number one. They have share of mind. What about Oracle? Too hard. GM? Too hard. You canât predict the future for these two companies. Too many variables.\nInvestment knowledge is cumulative, and things you learn will make you better in the future.

{"prompt":"Is there a moral connection to who you invest in? ->","completion":" Charlie and I went to Memphis to look at a chewing tobacco company. In the end, we decided we didnât want to own it. We would buy stock in a tobacco company, but we didnât want to own it.\nA good example is Charlieâs favorite company, Costco. They are the #3 distributor in the US of cigarettes, but you wouldnât avoid buying it because of that. Youâll drive yourself crazy trying to keep track of these things. Our philosophy is that itâs impossible to grade marketable securities, but weâll buy the stocks without any problems, but we just wonât be in certain businesses.\nMy view is that energy production should move to nuclear. Itâs clean, cheap and safe. Coal emissions are bad for the environment; however itâs still a good company. Itâs impossible to grade marketable securities on moral activity. Berkshire Hathaway has and will buy what trades, but will not buy companies that engage in certain behaviors. PetroChina owns 40% of the oil in the Sudan that is government owned. If they did not own it, someone else would. Also, you have to keep in mind, if PetroChina did not buy it its possible the Sudanese would own 100% of the oil rights and thatâs not so good either.\nI find it funny that people find time to protest PetroChina for ownership of the Sudanese oil, but with the $300 billion or so of imported goods from China, these same people donât protest Chinese goods. They protest investment in Chinese companies though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Who do you think will be one of the next greatest investors and are you partial to favoring someone with a similar investment style as yours? ->","completion":" We just finished looking for someone. The Board has 3 candidates to replace me as CEO and 4 candidates to replace me as investor. They are all doing fine where they are, but they would be willing to come over to Berkshire for less pay.\nIn 1969, I wound up my partnership and I had to help people find someone to manage their money. I recommended Bill Ruane of Sequoia Fund, Sandy Gottesman, who is currently on the board at Berkshire, and Walter Schloss, who I wrote about in âThe Superinvestors of Graham and Dodds-villeâ. Thereâs no way they could miss.\nBut I donât know many of the newer investors, theyâre not my contemporaries. Itâs not enough to just look at track records. They arenât predictive and there will always be a few people that do well. I know guys who can make 50% a year with $5 million, but not with $1 billion. The problem with guys that do well is they attract so much money that it neutralizes their advantage. Itâs hard to identify them, and even harder to make a deal to keep them from attracting other capital. Itâs like betting on a 12 year old horse that won at 3 years old. Itâs also important to avoid managers who use leverage. Itâs the reason that investors with 160 IQs flame out.\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What do you think of discounted cash flow (DCF) models? ->","completion":" Buffett: All investing is laying out cash now to get some more back in the future. The concept of âa bird in the handâ came from Aesop in about 600 BC. He knew a lot, but not that [he lived in] 600 BC. He couldnât know everything. [laughter] The question is, how many birds are in the bush? What is the discount rate? How confident are you that youâll get [the bird]? Et cetera. Thatâs what we do. If you need to use a computer or calculator to figure it out, you shouldnât [buy the investment]. Those types of [situations] fall into the âtoo-hardâ bucket. It should be obvious. It should shout at you, without all the spreadsheets. We see something better.\nMunger: Some of the worst business decisions Iâve seen came with detailed analysis. The higher math was false precision. They do that in business schools, because theyâve got to do something.\nBuffett: The priesthood has to look like they know more than âa bird in the hand.â You wonât get tenure if you say âa bird in the hand.â False precision is totally crazy. The markets saw it in the Long-Term Capital Management [hedge fund] in 1998. It only happens to people with high IQs. The markets of mid-September last year were [such that] you canât calculate standard deviations. Peopleâs actions donât observe laws of math. Itâs a terrible mistake to think higher math will take you a long wayâ you donât need to understand it, [and] it may lead you down the wrong path.\n"}
{"prompt":"Could you explain your opportunity cost decisions of the past year? ->","completion":" Buffett: Opportunity costs have been in the forefront of our minds during the last 18 months. Itâs tougher to calibrate A, versus B, versus C in a fast-changing environment. Tougher and possibly more profitable. We got lots of calls [for potential investments]âmost we ignored. We were called by Goldman Sachs on a Wednesday for $5 billion, and we [already] had a $5 billion commitment to Constellation Energy, $3 billion on Dow Chemical, $6.5 billion on the Wrigley Mars deal. We never want to get dependent on banks. Itâs a good sign that we havenât had the flurry [of phone calls] like last year. Normally, we would not have sold Johnson & Johnson if it were 10 â 15 points higher, [but we wanted to have a comfortable amount of cash on hand]. Our definition of comfortable is very comfortable.\n[Comment: The real cost of any purchase isnât the actual dollar cost. Rather, itâs the opportunity cost â the value of the investment you didnât make, because you used your funds to buy something else.]\n"}
{"prompt":"What are your views on diversification? ->","completion":" I have 2 views on diversification. If you are a professional and have confidence, then I would advocate lots of concentration. For everyone else, if itâs not your game, participate in total diversification. The economy will do fine over time. Make sure you donât buy at the wrong price or the wrong time. Thatâs what most people should do, buy a cheap index fund, and slowly dollar cost average into it. If you try to be just a little bit smart, spending an hour a week investing, youâre liable to be really dumb.\nIf itâs your game, diversification doesnât make sense. Itâs crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your 1st choice. âLebron Jamesâ analogy. If you have Lebron James on your team, donât take him out of the game just to make room for someone else. If you have a harem of 40 women, you never really get to know any of them well.\nCharlie and I operated mostly with 5 positions. If I were running 50, 100, 200 million, I would have 80% in 5 positions, with 25% for the largest. In 1964 I found a position I was willing to go heavier into, up to 40%. I told investors they could pull their money out. None did. The position was American Express after the Salad Oil Scandal. In 1951 I put the bulk of my net worth into GEICO. Later in 1998, LTCM was in trouble. With the spread between the on-the-run versus off-the-run 30 year Treasury bonds, I would have been willing to put 75% of my portfolio into it. There were various times I would have gone up to 75%, even in the past few years. If itâs your game and you really know your business, you can load up.\nOver the past 50-60 years, Charlie and I have never permanently lost more than 2% of our personal worth on a position. Weâve suffered quotational loss, 50% movements. Thatâs why you should never borrow money. We donât want to get into situations where anyone can pull the rug out from under our feet.\nIn stocks, itâs the only place where when things go on sale, people get unhappy. If I like a business, then it makes sense to buy more at 20 than at 30. If McDonalds reduces the price of hamburgers, I think itâs great.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Would you consider spinning off some companies to realize value? ->","completion":" Buffett: We will not be spinning off any companies. We canât wait to throw them [people who suggest spin offs] out of the office. We have a real advantage in allocating capitalâmoving money around. When we buy companies from people, we buy them for keeps. People can trust us to keep our word on this.\nMunger: Wall Street sells that stuff [spin-offs] for fees. It doesnât really do much for anyone. Short of some regulatory change, weâre unlikely to [spin something off].\nBuffett: We have listened to presentation after presentation by investment bankers, but there is always a fee.\n[Comment: A similar question was asked and addressed earlier in the meeting. Short of indefinite operating losses or intractable labor problems, Buffett is not going to spin-off subsidiaries like some poker player passing cards to his right in hopes of ârealizing value,â when doing so would damage his reputation as a buyer (and keeper) of businesses.]\n"}
{"prompt":"Why would you hold stocks forever, if the fundamentals change permanently? (Buy and hold) ->","completion":" Buffett: We donâtâwe sell plenty. If we lose confidence or conditions change, we sell. When in doubt, we keep holding. But for [our wholly-owned] companies, we hold and wonât sell unless a company promises to lose money indefinitely, or thereâs a labor problem. We buy for keeps and wonât sell, even if the offer is for more than [the company is] worth. If we were wrong, we sell. Last year, I sold a couple of billion dollarsâ worth of Johnson & Johnson just to raise cash for other purposesâan unusual situation. Someone asked us earlier what weâd do differently if we owned the whole company [Berkshire]. The answer is: nothing. We run Berkshire as if we owned 100%. Our peculiarity is our commitment to buy for keeps. People who sell their businesses to Berkshire know we wonât hire some management consultant or leverage it up, and thatâs a real advantage.\nMunger: The Berkshire system has legs, as they say in show business.\n"}

{"prompt":"Why do you think that despite making your methods publicly available, that relatively few people have been able to emulate your success? ->","completion":" I asked Graham the same question. Everyone took his class at ColumbiaBusiness School. He used current examples, and by the end of the semester you would have a portfolio that wouldâve made you money. Graham lived a life of sharing. He may have had more money hoarding, but lived happier because of it. The moneyâs just a figure in the paper, perhaps he wouldâve died with 86 million instead of 42 million, but it doesnât really matter. 90% of the people that took his class ended up doing something else.\nAt age 11 I started investing, purchasing three shares of Cities Service Preferred. I had read every book on investing in the Omaha library. I was really into charting and technical analysis. I loved it, but didnât make any money from it. At 19 I read Grahamâs âThe Intelligent Investorâ and it changed my world. Did Ben lose because I read his book? Maybe we competed and he made less money, but it didnât matter to Graham.\nThe philosophy either takes immediately or it doesnât at all. The reason gets down to temperament. People want to make money fast, but it doesnât happen that way. Grahamâs philosophy doesnât promise enough for many people. You donât know when it will happen, but you just wait for the fat pitches within your circle of competence. Itâs not as exciting as guessing whether the stock price will go up the next day. Most investors in internet companies didnât know the market cap. They were buying because they thought the stock would move, but if you asked them to write âI would buy XYZ company for $6 billion becauseâ, they wouldnât get halfway through the sentence. Itâs the classic tortoise versus hare, bound to work over time. Charlie and I have educated competitors. Most donât compete with us, though. Itâs fine, we have more than enough money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Could you give us your definition of stock market risk ->","completion":" We think first in terms of business risk. The key to Graham's approach to investing is not thinking of stocks as stocks or part of the stock market. Stocks are part of a business. People in this room own a piece of a business. If the business does well, they're going to do all right as long as long as they don't pay way too much to join in to that business. So we're thinking about business risk. Business risk can arise in various ways. It can arise from the capital structure. When somebody sticks a ton of debt into a business, if there's a hiccup in the business, then the lenders foreclose. It can come about by their nature--there are just certain businesses that are very risky. Back when there were more commercial aircraft manufacturers, Charlie and I would think of making a commercial  airplane as a sort of bet-your-company risk because you would shell out hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars before you really had customers, and then if you had a problem with the plane, the company could go. There are certain businesses that inherently, because of long lead time, because of heavy capital investment, basically have a lot of risk. Commodity businesses have a lot of risk unless you're a low-cost producer, because the low-cost producer can put you out of business. Our textile business was not the low-cost producer. We had fine management, everybody worked hard, we had cooperative unions, all kinds of things. But we weren't the low-cost producers so it was a risky business. The guy who could sell it cheaper than we could made it risky for us. We tend to go into businesses that are inherently low risk and are capitalized in a way that that low risk of the business is transformed into a low risk for the enterprise. The risk beyond that is that even though you identify such businesses, you pay too much for them. That risk is usually a risk of time rather than principal, unless you get into a really extravagant situation. Then the risk becomes the risk of you yourself--whether you can retain your belief in the real fundamentals of the business and not get too concerned about the stock market. The stock market is there to serve you and not to instruct you. That's a key to owning a good business and getting rid of the risk that would otherwise exist in the market.\nYou mention volatility--it doesn't make any difference to us whether the volatility of the stock market is a half a percentage of a point a day, or a quarter percent a day, or five percent a day. In fact, we'd probably make a lot more money if volatility was higher because it would create more mistakes in the market. Volatility is a huge plus to the real investor. Ben Graham used the example of Mr. Market. Ben said that just imagine that when you bought a stock you in effect bought into a business where you have this obliging partner who comes around every day and offers you a price at which he'll either buy or sell and that price is identical. No one ever gets that in a private business, where daily you get a buy-sell offer by a party. But you get that in the stock market, and that's a huge advantage. And it's a bigger advantage if this partner of yours is a heavy-drinking manic depressive. (laughter) The crazier he is, the more money you're going to make. So, as an investor, you love volatility. Not if you're on margin, but if you're an investor you're not on margin, and if you're an investor you love to get these wild swings because it means more things are going to get mispriced. \n\nActually, volatility in recent years has dampened from what it used to be. It looks bigger because people think in terms of Dow points, but volatility was much higher many years ago than it is now. The amplitude of the swings used to be really wild and that gave you more opportunity. Charlie?\n[CM:  Well it came to be that corporate finance departments at universities developed the notion of risk-adjusted returns. My best advice to all of you would be to totally ignore this development. Risk had a very good colloquial meaning, meaning a substantial chance that something could go horribly wrong, and the finance professors sort of got volatility mixed up with a bunch of foolish mathematics and to me it's less rational than what we do. And I don't think we're going to change.]\nFinance departments believe that volatility equals risk. They want to measure risk, and they don't know how to do it, basically. So they said volatility measures risk. I've often used the example of the Washington Post's stock. When I first bought it in 1973 it had gone down almost 50%, from a valuation of the whole company of close to $170 million down to $80 million. Because it happened pretty fast, the beta of the stock had actually increased, and a professor would have told you that the company was more risky if you bought it for $80 million than if you bought it for $170 million. That's something I've thought about ever since they told me that 25 years ago and I still haven't figured it out. (laughter)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"How much and how does risk factor into your investment decisions? Would you invest in emerging markets? ->","completion":" In general, emerging markets are not great for me because I need to put a lot of money to work. Risk does not equal beta. Risk comes around because you donât understand things, not because of beta. There are normally 10 filters or so that I go through when I hear an idea. The first is can I understand the business and understand the downside not just today but five to ten years from now. There have been very few times that Iâve lost 1% of my net worth. I might be risk averse but I am not action adverse. Mrs. B saved $500 over the course of 16 years to start and build Nebraska Furniture Mart. Tom Watson Sr of IBM said, âIâm smart in spots and I stay in those spots.â I just stay within my circle of confidence. When I bought Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983, Mrs. B took cash and not Berkshire stock. Why? She didnât understand the value of stock. She understood cash and that is what she took. I need only need to be right a few times and can let thousands of ideas go by.\nTed Williams, who wrote the âScience of Hitting,â broke the strike zone into 92 ball shaped sections. He knew, if hit in his sweet spot, heâd hit 430, a little further out, and heâd hit 350. You have to know your sweet spot. The beautiful thing about investing is that itâs a âNo called strike gameâ where unlike baseball the only strikes in investing are when you swing. I donât have to swing.\nWhen I do invest, I donât care if the stock price goes from $10 to $2 but I do care about if the value went from $10 to $2. Avoid debt. I decided early on that I never wanted to owe more than 25% of my net worth, and I havenâtâ¦ except for in the very beginning. I like to play from a position of strength. I always try to have the odds in my favor. When I go to Vegas, I donât go around putting $5 dollars on the blackjack tables. If someone wants to come to my room and put $5 on my bed, well thatâs fine. I like those odds better.\n\n"}

It just doesnât make any sense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"How often do you review each position in your portfolio? ->","completion":" Buffett: It breaks down into two periods of my life: when I had more ideas than money, I was constantly reviewing my portfolio, figuring out which stock to unload to buy a new one.\nToday, I have more money than ideas so we arenât really thinking of selling when the alternative is cash. But weâre always collecting information on every company we own â it is a continuous process, but not with the idea that daily, weekly or monthly activity will result.\nIf we needed money for a very big deal, $20-, $30- or $40-billion, and we had to sell $10 billion in equities, weâd use information weâve been collecting daily to decide what to sell.\nMunger: Even in Warrenâs early days, he wasnât thinking about his #1 choice [his single favorite stock] â he could put that aside [because heâd never sell it].\nBuffett: We think about adding more to certain stocks and have done so. We add to ones that look attractive and that we can buy. If you look at the portfolio at the end of 2007 youâll see that certain positions have been increased by billions of dollars. We like many of our positions and if they get cheap, weâll buy more.\nSometimes thereâs not enough stock or we might cross certain thresholds that cause reporting requirements or going above 10%, which triggers the short-swing rule.\nMunger: Itâs not as easy as it looks to buy these big positions. When we were buying Coca-Cola, we bought every share we could â we bought 30-40% of the volume, yet it still took us a long time to accumulate our position. However, we like it better when we have these problems now than when we didnât earlier.\nBuffett: We usually feel we can buy 20% of the daily volume and not move the market too much. That means if we want to buy $5 billion, we have to wait for $25 billion to trade and not a lot of stocks trade that much.\n"}
{"prompt":"What are your expectations for future returns on stocks? ->","completion":" When I closed the Buffett Partnership, I felt (and wrote to my investors) that the prospective return was about the same for equities and municipal bonds over the next decade, and I was roughly right. Itâs not the same today. Iâd have 100% of bonds in short-term bonds. Forced to choose between owning the S&P 500 vs. 20-year bonds, Iâd buy stocks â and it would not be a close decision. But I wouldnât have an equity investment with someone who charged high fees.\nWe donât have the faintest idea where the S&P or bonds will be in three years, but over 20 years weâd prefer to own stocks.\nMunger: We think there will be a disruption not too many years ahead.\nBuffett: Of course, you could have said that and have been right at any point in the past century â there are always disruptions â but stocks have still done well. Weâd rather have good stocks than sit around and hope they get cheaper, so anytime we see something good, we buy, hopefully in size.\n[Q - If you were to follow up on your Fortune article from 1999 about the lean and fat periods (Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market), what would you be writing? You talked about 17-year periods. How is it turning out now, since weâre halfway through the next one?]\nThereâs nothing magical about 17-year periods â I just had a little fun with it because there were two 17-year periods, and there are 17-year locusts.\nIn 1999, people were extrapolating from the experience of the previous 17 years and had unrealistic expectations. They were bound to be disappointed.\nIf I were writing something now, Iâd say Iâd have expectations beyond 4.75% â I donât know how much more, but more for sure. I would not have high expectations for equities, but better than for bonds.\nMunger: Since that article was written, the experience from owning equities has been pretty lean, so Warrenâs been right so far and I suspect is right now to have modest expectations.\nBuffett: Itâs hard to be right every day or week or month â thatâs what happens if youâre on TV too often. [Tilson - He mentioned 1974 and a few other years in which he made market predictions; I wrote a column about this in 1999, Buffettâs Prescient Market Calls, suggesting my readers heed Buffettâs warning in the Fortune article. Incidentally, Buffettâs Market Call #5 highlighted in my article proved to be particularly correct: from 1993-2002 the S&P 500 compounded at 9.4% annually, far less than the 16.1% of the 10 previous years]. But every now and then, things really get out of whack. But the gradations in between are too tough. If you own great businesses, you should just hold on most of the time, maybe sell if the valuations get extremely high and buy more if they get really cheap like in the early 1970s.\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you expect the stock market premium to continue to be 6.5% over bonds? ->","completion":" I don't think that the stock market will return 6.5% over bonds in the future. Stocks usually yield a little more, but that isn't ordained. Every once in a while, stocks will get very cheap, but it isn't ordained in scripture that this is so. Risk premiums are mostly nonsense. The world isn't calculating risk premiums.\nThe best book prior to Graham was written by Edgar Lawrence Smith in 1924 called Common Stocks as Long Term Investments. It was a study that evaluated how bonds compared to stocks in various decades of the past. There weren't a whole lot of publicly traded companies back then. He thought he knew what he was going to find. He thought that he'd find that bonds outperformed stocks during periods of deflation, and stocks outperformed during inflationary times. But what he found was that stocks outperformed the bonds in nearly all cases. John M. Keynes then enumerated the reasons that this was so. He said that over time you have more capital working for you, and thus dividends would grow higher. This was novel information back then and investors then went crazy and started buying stocks for these higher returns. But then they started to get crazy, and no longer really applied the sound tactics that made the reasons given in the book true. Be careful that when you buy something for a sound reason, make sure that the reason stays sound.\nIf you buy GM, you need to write the price and the respective market valuation. Then write down why you are buying the business.

{"prompt":"You have espoused a constant ROE on the stock market of about 13%, over time.

When option programs are present in a company, what do you think is a realistic way of valuing them on a cash basis? ->","completion":" The questioner is Jon Brandt, the son of a very good friend of mine for many years. Jon is referring to an article I wrote for Fortune in the 1970Ââs - and heÂâs also referring to the tremendous ROE shown on the S&P 500, which includes the effects of restructurings.\nEven allowing for the effects of stock options, I have still been surprised by the returns on equity shown by the S&P 500. As for options, we look at what the value of average option issuance is going to be over the next five years and figure what theyÂâd be worth as warrants to the [issuing] company. ThatÂâs what we use as a cost to shareholders.\nThis should be shown as an expense in the income statement. I think a number of auditors believed it should be a cost but their clients pressured them and caved, and then Congress got called in. I think itÂâs a scandal. Charlie?\n[Munger: ItÂâs fundamentally wrong not to have honest accounting. ItÂâs wrong to have little corruptions, that later can become big corruptions. The accounting in America is corrupt. It is not a good idea to have corrupt accounting.\nItÂâs like campaign reform. Once you get a number of players benefitting, itÂâs hard to get reform. ItÂâs the same thing with options accounting. It would have been better to have reform a couple decades ago, when it wasnÂât such a big thing.\nThat doesnÂât mean that weÂâre against options. They could make sense here at some point, but not with Charlie and me.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you think investors expect too much? ->","completion":" The problem is the starting point in predicting modest returns for equity investors. [Expectations were too high.] In 1999, a Gallup poll showed people expected 15% [returns from stocks] in a low inflation environment. In a low inflation environment, how much will GDP grow? If there's 2% inflation and 3% [real] growth, that's 5%. This will be the rate of corporate growth, so if you add dividends, you get 6-7% [annualized returns] before frictional costs -- and investors incur high frictional costs (they don't have to, but they do) -- which adds up to 1.5%. [This 4.5-5.5% is] not bad.\n[CM: My attitude is slightly more negative than Warren's.]\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIt [6-7% growth] is not the end of the world. If we get 5-6% of the pie -- those of us who put our capital out -- I don't know if it's exactly what someone who designed the universe would come up with, but I don't think that's crazy in either direction. It provides a pretty decent real return in a period of low inflation. If you get high inflation, you could get very low real returns, even negative.\n[CM: I don't you'll get real help from me or from economists either. If an economist saw a job going to China, he doesn't care -- it saves costs. But if all the jobs go to China, what then?

{"prompt":"What's your investment hurdle rate? ->","completion":" 10% is the figure we quit on -- we don't want to buy equities when the real return we expect is less than 10%, whether interest rates are 6% or 1%. It's arbitrary. 10% is not that great after tax.\n[CM: We're guessing at our future opportunity cost. Warren is guessing that he'll have the opportunity to put capital out at high rates of return, so he's not willing to put it out at less than 10% now. But if we knew interest rates would stay at 1%, we'd change. Our hurdles reflect our estimate of future opportunity costs.]\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWe could take the $16 billion we have in cash earning 1.5% and invest it in 20-year bonds earning 5% and increase our current earnings a lot, but we're betting that we can find a good place to invest this cash and don't want to take the risk of principal loss of long-term bonds [if interest rates rise, the value of 20-year bonds will decline].\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you prefer public or private investments? ->","completion":" Berkshire has previously said that they would prefer more private investments but have trouble finding suitable ones. At the present time, the public market offers more opportunity. There are very few good private situations around and those that are available tend to be overpriced. Berkshire has a billion dollars in cash at present.\nBuffett says there is more possibility of significant \"mispricing\" in the public stock market. This is because emotion plays a larger role in the public market, and the very superficial knowledge with which most investors operate. Owners of significant private business on the other hand, tend to have a much better idea of what their businesses are really worth.\nThere is very tough competition currently for the few good private businesses of decent size from: MBO funds or LBO funds. Typically these funds are run by people using other people's capital; they benefit from upside but don't suffer as much from downside since it is not their money that is at stake. Therefore, they are less worried about overpaying for a business\nOther public companies. They don't mind overpaying; management of these types of companies are often more focused on size, than on return on investment and often are not big shareholders. These types of buyers don't mind issuing new stock in payment, whereas Berkshire doesn't like to issue new common stock.\nBuffett definitely feels that the \"stock market is far less efficient than the private market\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Investors eventually repeat their mistakes. How can you prevent this--through fast growth or safety? ->","completion":" If you understood a business perfectly and the future of the business, you would need very little in the way of a margin of safety. So, the more vulnerable the business is, assuming you still want to invest in it, the larger margin of safety you'd need. If you're driving a truck across a bridge that says it holds 10,000 pounds and you've got a 9,800 pound vehicle, if the bridge is 6 inches above the crevice it covers, you may feel okay, but if it's over the Grand Canyon, you may feel you want a little larger margin of safety in terms of driving only drive a 4,000 pound truck across. It depends on the nature of the underlying risk. We don't get the margin of safety now that we got in the 1970s.\nThe best thing is to learn from other guys' mistakes. Patton used to say, \"It's an honor to die for your country; make sure the other guy gets the honor.\" There are a lot of mistakes that I've repeated. The biggest one, the biggest category over time, is being reluctant to pay up a little for a business that I knew was really outstanding. The cost of that I think is in the billions, and I'll probably keep making that mistake. The mistakes are made when there are businesses you can understand and that are attractive and you don't do something about them. I don't worry at all about the mistakes that come about like when I met Bill Gates and didn't buy Microsoft or something like that. Most of our mistakes have been mistakes of omission rather than commission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Why do large caps outperform small caps? ->","completion":" We don't care if a company is large cap, small cap, middle cap, micro cap. It doesn't make any difference. The only questions that matter to us:\nFrom my personal standpoint running Berkshire now because we got, pro forma for Gen. Re, $75 to $80 billion to invest in and I only want to invest in five things, so I am really limited to very big companies. But if I were investing $100,000, I wouldn't care whether something was large cap or small cap or anything. I would just look for businesses I understood.\nNow, I think, on balance, large cap companies as businesses have done extraordinarily well the last ten years--way better than people anticipated they would do. You really have American businesses earning close to something 20% on equity. And that is something nobody dreamed of and that is being produced by very large companies in aggregate. So you have had this huge revaluation upwards because of lower interest rates and much higher returns on capital. If America business is really a disguised bond that earns 20%, a 20% coupon it is much better than a bond with a 13% coupon. And that has happened with big companies in recent years, whether it is permanent or not is another question. I am skeptical of that. I wouldn't even think about it--except for questions of how much money we run--I wouldn't even think about the size of the business. See's Candy was a $25 million business when we bought it. If I can find one now, as big as we are, I would love to buy it. It is the certainty of it that counts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}

{"prompt":"What is the benefit of being an out-of-towner as opposed to being on Wall Street? ->","completion":" I worked on Wall Street for a couple of years and I have my best friends on both coasts. I like seeing them. I get ideas when I go there. But the best way to think about investments is to be in a room with no one else and just think. And if that doesnât work, nothing else is going to work. The disadvantage of being in any type of market environment like Wall Street in the extreme is that you get over-stimulated. You think you have to do something every day. The Chandler family paid $2,000 for this company (Coke). You donât have to do much else if you pick one of those. And the trick then is not to do anything else. Even not to sell at 1919, which the family did later on. So what you are looking for is some way to get one good idea a year. And then ride it to its full potential and that is very hard to do in an environment where people are shouting prices back and forth every five minutes and shoving reports in front of your nose and all that. Wall Street makes its money on activity. You make your money on inactivity.\nIf everyone in this room trades their portfolio around every day with every other person, you will all end up broke. And the intermediary will end up with all the money. If you all own stock in a group of average businesses and just sit here for the next 50 years, you will end up with a fair amount of money and your broker will be broke. He is like the Doctor who gets paid on how often to get you to change pills. If he gave you one pill that cures you the rest of your life, he would make one sale, one transaction and that is it. But if he can convince you that changing pills every day is the way to great health, it will be great for him and the prescriptionists. You wonât be any healthier and you will be a lot worse off financially. You want to stay away from any environment that stimulates activity. And Wall Street would have the effective of doing that.\nWhen I went back to Omaha, I would go back with a whole list of companies I wanted to check out and I would get my moneyâs worth out of those trips, but then I would go back to Omaha and think about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}

But that is about the only thing that I do a whole lot different.\nI didn't know my salary when I went to work for Graham until I got his first paycheck. Do what you love and don't even think about the money. I will take a trip on Paul Allen's Octopus ($400M yacht), but wouldn't want one for myself. A 60 man crew is needed. They could be stealing, sleeping with each other, etc. Professional sports teams are a hassle, especially when you have as much money as him. Fans would complain that you aren't spending enough when the team loses.\nIf there is a place that is warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and you do what you love doing, you will do fine.

{"prompt":"Don't you have a lot of competition to buy great businesses? For example, from private equity funds? ->","completion":" You are absolutely correct that the private equity funds are a form of competition for Berkshire.  Stocks sometimes trade well below intrinsic value, but businesses are sold in a negotiated transaction, so pricing doesnât get as extreme.  But our strong preference is to buy entire businesses at a fair price rather than stocks, even if stocks [can be acquired] a bit cheaper.\nIf someone wants what we are offering, we are pretty much one-of-a-kind.  People can sell their company to us, yet continue to run it as they please as long as they want.  So, if someone needs liquidity for tax or inheritance or other reasons, but doesnât want to auction their business off like a piece of meat, they can come to us and they know theyâll get the response they want.  We donât get super bargains this way, but it allows us to put money to work at a sensible price.\nAcquisitions donât come along every day.\nIf I owned a business that my father had started and wanted to monetize it, I would sell to Berkshire because I wouldnât want to split it up to auction it off, just as it would be silly to auction your daughter off to the man who bids the most.\nThere is no-one else who can make the promises we can make [not to ever sell the acquired company].  Most big companies canât do that because what if the board decides it wants a pure play?  I tell sellers that Iâm the only one who can double cross you â nobody else can.  We donât have consultants or Wall Street advisors.\nBut, yes, we do have a lot of competition.\n[CM: Weâve had private equity competitors for a long time, but one way or another weâve managed to buy quite a few things.]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}

A lot isnât fraud â just the frictional costs and the baloney. Charlie and I have had very good luck buying businesses and putting our trust in people â itâs been overwhelmingly good, but we filter out a lot of people. People give themselves away and maybe itâs an advantage being around awhile and seeing how people give themselves away by what they talk about and whatâs important and not important to them. Weâve had a batting average I wouldnât have thought weâd have. We havenât batted 100%, but itâs above 90%.\nMunger: Weâre deeply suspicious if the proposition sounds too good to be true. I recall a deal that was pitched to us by someone who said the company only wrote fire insurance on concrete bridges covered by water. Itâs like taking candy from a baby. [Laughter] We stay away from businesses like that.\nBuffett: When they make certain kinds of comments, what they laugh about, if they say âitâs so easy.â Itâs not so easy. We rule out people 90% of the time. Maybe weâre wrong sometimes, but whatâs important is the ones we let in. In the 1970s when I referred my clients to three people [as he closed down the Buffett Partnership], when I thought who they should turn over 100% of their money to, there were hundreds of people with great records. I recommended Charlie, Sandy Gottesman and Bill Ruane. I couldnât have told you which of the three would be the best, but the one thing I was sure of was that they were going to be sensational stewards of money and do what was right for clients rather then try to make 2x in commissions in a given year. Anytime someone who takes what I think is an unfair fee structure because they can get it, I rule them out.\n"}
{"prompt":"What's your philosophy on partnering with others? ->","completion":" We normally donât want to do deals with partners. If we like a deal, we want to do it all.

{"prompt":"We know that you are a big bridge player. Do you think that bridge correlates to investing? Are there any traits or characteristics that might carry over from one to the other? ->","completion":" Bridge is the best game there is. Youâre drawing inferences from every bid and play of a card, and every card that is or isnât played. It teaches you about partnership and other human skills. In bridge, you draw inferences from everything and that carries over well into investing. In bridge, similar to in life, youâll never get the same hand twice but the past does have a meaning. The past does not make the future definitive but you can draw from those experiences. I think the partnership aspect of bridge is a great lesson for life. If Iâm going into battle, I want to partner with the best. I was playing with a world champion and we were playing against my sister and her husband. We lost, so I took the scorepad and I ate it. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you think about value? ->","completion":" The formula for value was handed down from 600 BC by a guy named Aesop. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Investing is about laying out a bird now to get two or more out of the bush. The keys are to only look at the bushes you like and identify how long it will take to get them out. When interest rates are 20%, you need to get it out right now. When rates are 1%, you have 10 years. Think about what the asset will produce. Look at the asset, not the beta. I donât really care about volatility. Stock price is not that important to me, it just gives you the opportunity to buy at a great price. I donât care if they close the NYSE for 5 years. I care more about the business than I do about events. I care about if thereâs price flexibility and whether the company can gain more market share. I care about people drinking more Coke.\nI bought a farm from the FDIC 20 years ago for $600 per acre. Now I donât know anything about farming but my son does. I asked him, how much it cost to buy corn, plow the field, harvest, how much an acre will yield, what price to expect. I havenât gotten a quote on that farm in 20 years.\nIf I were running a business school I would only have 2 courses. The first would obviously be an investing class about how to value a business. The second would be how to think about the stock market and how to deal with the volatility. The stock market is funny. You have no compulsion to act and a bunch of silly people setting prices all the time, it is great odds. I want the market to be like a manic depressive drunk. Grahamâs Ch. 8, in the book Intelligent Investor, on Mr. Market is the most important thing I have ever read. Now think about the NYSE. You have thousands of companies to choose from. For me, that universe has shrunk because I need to put large dollar amounts to work. Attitude is much more important than IQ. You can really get into trouble with a high IQ, i.e. Long-Term Capital. You need to have the right philosophical temperament.\n\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you calculate intrinsic value? ->","completion":" Intrinsic value is terribly important but very fuzzy. We try to work with businesses where we have fairly high probability of knowing what the future will hold. If you own a gas pipeline, not much is going to go wrong. Maybe a competitor enters forcing you to cut prices, but intrinsic value hasn't gone down if you already factored this in. We looked at a pipeline recently that we think will come under pressure from other ways of delivering gas [to the area the pipeline serves]. We look at this differently from another pipeline that has the lowest costs [and does not face threats from alternative pipelines]. If you calculate intrinsic value properly, you factor in things like declining prices.\nWhen we buy business, we try to look out and estimate the cash it will generate and compare it to the purchase price. We have to feel pretty good about our projections and then have a purchase price that makes sense. Over time, we've had more pleasant surprises than we would have expected.\nI've never seen an investment banker's book in which future earnings are projected to go down. But many businesses' earnings go down. We made this mistake with Dexter shoes -- it was earning $40 million pretax and I projected this would continue, and I couldn't have been more wrong.\n20% of Fortune 500 companies will be earning significant less in five years, but I don't know which 20%. If you can't come up with reasonable estimates for that, then you move on.\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What do you believe to be the most important tools in determining intrinsic value?  What rules or standards do you apply when using these tools? ->","completion":" If we could see in looking at any business what its future cash flows would be for the next 100 years, and discount that back at an appropriate interest rate, that would give us a number for intrinsic value. It would be like looking at a bond that had a bunch of coupons on it that was due in a hundred years ... Businesses have coupons too, the only problem is that they're not printed on the instrument and it's up to the investor to try to estimate what those coupons are going to be over time. In high-tech businesses, or something like that, we don't have the faintest idea what the coupons are going to be. In the businesses where we think we can understand them reasonably well, we are trying to print the coupons out. If you attempt to assess intrinsic value, it all relates to cash flow. The only reason to put cash into any kind of investment now is that you expect to take cash out--not by selling it to somebody else, that's just a game of who beats who--but by the asset itself ... If you're an investor, you're looking on what the asset is going to do, if you're a speculator, you're commonly focusing on what the price of the object is going to do, and that's not our game. We feel that if we're right about the business, we're going to make a lot of money, and if we're wrong about the business, we don't have any hopes of making money.\n[CM:  I would argue that one filter that's useful in investing is the idea of opportunity costs. If you have one idea that's available in large quantity that's better that 98% of the other opportunities, then you can just screen out the other 98% ... With this attitude you get a concentrated portfolio, which we don't mind. That practice of ours which is so simple is not widely copied, I don't know why. Even at great universities and intellectual institutions. It's an interesting question: If we're right, why are so many other places so wrong.]\n\t\t\t\nThere are several possible answers to that question! (laughter) The first question we ask ourselves is, would we rather own this business than more Coca-Cola, than more Gillette .... We will want companies where the certainty gets close to that, or we would figure we'd be better off buying more Coke. If every management, before they bought a business, said is this better than buying in our own stock or even buying Coca-Cola stock, there'd be a lot less deals done. We try to measure against what we regard as close to perfection as we can get.\n\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Could you comment on the matter of intrinsic value as it applies to some of the Inevitables? ->","completion":" Well, we won't stick a price on it. They are absolutely wonderful businesses run by sensational people, and they are selling at prices that are higher than they've sold at most of the time. But they may well be worth it, either in present terms, or they may be a couple of years ahead of themselves. Gillette doesn't repurchase their shares ... Coke consistently repurchases their shares. We generally like the policy of companies that have really wonderful businesses repurchasing their shares. The problem with most companies repurchasing their shares is that they are frequently so-so businesses and they are repurchasing shares for purposes other than intensifying the interest of shareholders in a wonderful business. It's hard to do things intelligently with money in this world and Coke has been very intelligent about using their capital, particularly to fortify and develop their bottler network around the world, but there's only so far you can go with that, and to enhance the ownership of shareholders in a company like Coca-Cola [is great].\nThe bottling is actually kind of interesting ... Asa Canver back in the late 1880's essentially bought the whole Coca-Cola company for $2,000, and that may be the smartest purchase in the history of the world. Then in 1889, a couple of guys from Chattanooga came along, and in those days soft drinks were sold over the counter, and they said bottling's got a future and you're busy with the pump side of the business, so why don't you let us develop the bottling side of the business. And I guess Mr. Canver didn't think much of bottling, so he gave them a contract that gave them the rights, in perpetuity for almost all of the United States, and gave them the right to buy Coca-Cola syrup at a fixed price forever. (audience groans) So Asa, who had scored with his $2,000 in a major way, seems to have made one of the dumbest contracts in history.\nAnd the Coca-Cola company was faced over the years with the problem of having this bottling system which soon became the dominant system of distribution for Coke, being subject to a contract where there was no price flexibility and where the contract ran for perpetuity. And of course every bottler on his deathbed would call his children and grandchildren around, and he would prop himself up, and he would croak out in his last breath, \"Don't let 'em screw with the bottling contract.\" (laughter)\nSo the Coca-Cola company faced this for decades, and they couldn't really do anything about the bottling system for a long time, and Roberto and Don Keough and some other people spent 20, 25 years getting that rationalized ...it was a huge, huge project, but it made an enormous difference over time, and that's what I mean when I talk about intellectual capital. You know you're not going to get results on that in a day or a month or a year, but they decided that to get the job done they had to do this, and they used capital to get that job done, but they used capital beyond that to repurchase shares, and it's been very smart, and they're probably repurchasing shares even as we talk.\n[CM: I do think the Coca-Cola company is one of the most interesting cases in the history of business, and it ought to be way more studied than it is. There's just lesson after lesson after lesson in the history of the Coca-Cola company. But it's too long a story for today.]\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"When you estimate intrinsic value in capital intensive companies like McDonald's and Walgreens where a very healthy and growing operating cash flow is largely offset by expenditures for new stores, restaurants, etc how do you estimate future free cash flow? And at what rate do you discount those cash flows? ->","completion":" We use the same discount rate across all securities. We may be more conservative in estimating cash in some situations.\nJust because interest rates are at 1.5% doesn't mean we like an investment that yields 2-3%. We have minimum thresholds in our mind that are a whole lot higher than government rates. When we're looking at a business, we're looking at holding it forever, so we don't assume rates will always be this low.\n"}
{"prompt":"Is the skill of judging risk just as important as calculating intrinsic value? ->","completion":" We perceive risk as items that impair future business. Wants to have mathematical risk on their side over a group of decisions. Not in the business of assuming a lot of risk in business. We look for moats around businesses. We look for castles (businesses) that have a moat surrounding it which is expanding as a primary consideration of a great business.\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What valuation metrics do you use? ->","completion":" The appropriate multiple for a business compared to the S&P 500 depends on its return on equity and return on incremental invested capital. I wouldn't look at a single valuation metric like relative P\/E ratio. I don't think price-to-earnings, price-to-book or price-to-sales ratios tell you very much. People want a formula, but it's not that easy. To value something, you simply have to take its free cash flows from now until kingdom come and then discount them back to the present using an appropriate discount rate. All cash is equal. You just need to evaluate a business's economic characteristics.\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What do you think of the use of book values in making investment decisions? ->","completion":" Book value is virtually not a consideration in investment decision-making at Berkshire. Their pursuit of high return businesses usually leads to companies with minimal book values. He added that the book value approach could work well with small sums of money, like Graham had managed, and that the approach had worked well for Graham-type practitioners like BuffettÂâs friend Walter Schloss. The three most important concepts conveyed by Graham in ÂâThe Intelligent InvestorÂâ were the investorÂâs attitude toward the market, the Ââmargin of safetyÂâ, and the practice of looking at companies as businesses, not stocks.\nMunger proffered that Ââprojections generally do more harm than good, and are usually prepared by persons who have some sort of an interest in the outcome of actions based on the projections. They often have a precision thatÂâs deceptive.Ââ Buffett added that theyÂâve never looked at a projection in connection with an equity or business that theyÂâve acquired. ÂâItÂâs a ritual to justify doing what an executive or a board wanted to do in the first place.Â\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"If you canât talk with management, and canât read the annual report, and didnât know the price, but could only look at the financial statements, what metric would you look at? ->","completion":" WB: Investing is laying out money now to get more money later on. Letâs leave the market price out. If you were buying a farm, you would think about bushels per acre â you are looking to the asset itself.

I have bought stocks the way you describe. They were in businesses I understood, and if I could buy at 40% of X, Iâd be okay with the margin of safety. If you donât tell me the nature of the business, financial statements wonât tell me much. Weâve bought many securities, and with most, weâve never met management. We use our general understanding of business and look to specifics from financial statements.\nCM: One metric catches people. We prefer businesses that drown in cash. An example of a different business is construction equipment. You work hard all year and there is your profit sitting in the yard. We avoid businesses like that. We prefer those that can write us a check at the end of the year.\nWB: We could value an apartment if we knew where the apartment is, and we know the monthly checks. I have bought a lot of things off the financials. There is a lot I wouldnât buy even if it had the best management in the world, as it doesnât make much difference in a bad business.\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you think about growth rates when you value businesses? ->","completion":" When the [long-term] growth rate is higher than the discount rate, then [mathematically] the value is infinity.  This is the St. Petersburg Paradox, written about by Durand 30 years ago.  [Click   here for a copy of the original 1957 article.  For more on this topic, I recommend Integrating the Outliers: Two Lessons from the St. Petersburg Paradox, by CSFBâs (now Legg Masonâs) Michael Mauboussin.]\nSome managements think this [that the value of their company is infinite].  It gets very dangerous to assume high growth rates to infinity â thatâs where people get into a lot of trouble.  The idea of projecting extremely high growth rates for a long period of time has cost investors an awful lot of money.  Go look at top companies 50 years ago: how many have grown at 10% for a long time?  And [those that have grown] 15% is very rarified. \nCharlie and I are rarely willing to project high growth rates.  Maybe weâre wrong sometimes and that costs us, but we like to be conservative.\n[CM: If your growth rate is so high that you conclude the business has an infinite valuation, you have to use more realistic numbers.  What else could anyone do?]\n\t\t\t\n"}

{"prompt":"What is the ideal business? ->","completion":" The ideal business is one that generates very high returns on capital and can invest that capital back into the business at equally high rates. Imagine a $100 million business that earns 20% in one year, reinvests the $20 million profit and in the next year earns 20% of $120 million and so forth. But there are very very few businesses like this. Coke has high returns on capital, but incremental capital doesn't earn anything like its current returns. We love businesses that can earn high rates on even more capital than it earns. Most of our businesses generate lots of money, but can't generate high returns on incremental capital -- for example, See's and Buffalo News. We look for them [areas to wisely reinvest capital], but they don't exist.\nSo, what we do is take money and move it around into other businesses. The newspaper business earned great returns but not on incremental capital. But the people in the industry only knew how to reinvest it [so they squandered a lot of capital]. But our structure allows us to take excess capital and invest it elsewhere, wherever it makes the most sense. It's an enormous advantage.\nSee's has produced $1 billion pre-tax for us over time. If we'd deployed that in the candy business, the returns would have been terrible, but instead we took the money out of the business and redeployed it elsewhere. Look at the results!\n[CM: There are two kinds of businesses: The first earns 12%, and you can take it out at the end of the year. The second earns 12%, but all the excess cash must be reinvested -- there's never any cash. It reminds me of the guy who looks at all of his equipment and says, \"There's all of my profit.\" We hate that kind of business.]\n\t\t\t\nWe like to be able to move cash around and find it's best use. We'd love to have our companies redeploy cash, but they can't. Gillette has a great business, but can't sensibly reinvest all of the profit.\nWe don't think the batting average of American industry redeploying capital has been very great. We knock other people doing what has made us so successful.\n[CM: I'm uncomfortable with that, which is why we say negative things [to discourage others from trying to do what we do]].\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What makes a great business? ->","completion":" The best businesses can maintain their earnings without continued reinvestment, whereas in the worst you have to keep pouring money into a money-losing business.\nThe best business is being the best surgeon in town. You donât have to do any reinvestment â the investment was the education. The surgeon will retain his earnings power, regardless of inflation.\n[Untapped pricing power. The measure of a great business.]\nWe like buying businesses with some untapped pricing power. For example, when we bought Seeâs for $25 million, I asked myself, âIf we raised prices by 10 cents per pound, would sales fall off a cliff?â The answer was obviously no. You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices.\nA good example is newspapers. The local daily paper controlled the market and every year they raised the [advertising] rates and circulation prices â it was almost a big yawn. They didnât worry about losing big advertisers like Sears, JC Penney or Wal-Mart, or losing subscribers. They increased prices whether the price of newsprint went up or down.\nNow, they agonize over price increases because they worry about driving people to other mediums. That world has changed.\nYou can learn a lot about the durable economics of a business by watching price behavior. The beer industry is able to raise prices, but itâs getting tougher.\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"When you are looking at a business in which to invest, what are your priorities? ->","completion":" You have to really understand the economics of a business and the kind of people you are getting into business with. They have to love their business. They have to feel that they have been creative, that it is their painting, I am not going to disturb it, just give them more canvas and more brushes, but its their painting, from our standpoint any way. The whole place will reflect the attitude of the person at the top, if you have someone at the top who doesnât care, the people down below wonât care. On the other hand, if you have someone at the top who cares a great deal, that will be evident across the organization. [The type of people managing the business is a very important criteria, then?] Yes, contracts donât protect you; you have to have confidence in the people.\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What makes a company something that you like? ->","completion":" I like businesses that I can understand. Letâs start with that. That narrows it down by 90%. There are all types of things I donât understand, but fortunately, there is enough I do understand. You have this big wide world out there and almost every company is publicly owned. So you have all American business practically available to you. So it makes sense to go with things you can understand.\nI can understand this, anyone can understand this (Buffett holds up a bottle of Coca-Cola). Since 1886, it is a simple business, but it is not an easy businessâI donât want an easy business for competitors. I want a business with a moat around it. I want a very valuable castle in the middle and then I want the Duke who is in charge of that castle to be very honest and hard working and able. Then I want a moat around that castle. The moat can be various things: The moat around our auto insurance business, Geico, is low cost.\nPeople have to buy auto insurance so everyone is going to have one auto insurance policy per car basically. I canât sell them 20, but they have to buy one. I can sell them 1. What are they going to buy it on? (based on what criteria?) They (customers) will buy based on service and cost. Most people will assume the service is identical among companies or close enough. So they will do it on cost. So I have to be a low cost producer--that is my moat. To the extent that my costs are further below the other guy, I have thrown a couple of sharks into the moat. All the time you have this wonderful castle, there are people out there who are going to attack it and try to take it away from you. I want a castle I can understand, but I want a castle with a moat around it.\n30 years ago, Eastman Kodakâs moat was just as wide as Coca-Colaâs moat. I mean if you were going to take a picture of your six-month old baby and you want to look at that picture 20 years from now or 50 years from now. And you are never going to get a chanceâyou are not a professional photographerâso you can evaluate what is going to look good 20 or 50 years ago. What is in your mind about that photography company (Share of Mind) is what counts. Because they are promising you that the picture you take today is going to be terrific 20 to 50 years from now about something that is very important to you. Well, Kodak had that in spades 30 years ago, they owned that. They had what I call share of mind. Forget about share of market, share of mind. They had somethingâthat little yellow boxâthat said Kodak is the best. That is priceless. They have lost some of that. They havenât lost it all.\nIt is not due to George Fisher. George is doing a great job, but they let that moat narrow. They let Fuji come and start narrowing the moat in various ways. They let them get into the Olympics and take away that special aspect that only Kodak was fit to photograph the Olympics. So Fuji gets there and immediately in peopleâs minds, Fuji becomes more into parity with Kodak.\nYou havenât seen that with Coke; Cokeâs moat is wider now than it was 30 years ago. You canât see the moat day by day but every time the infrastructure that gets built in some country that isnât yet profitable for Coke that will be 20 years from now. The moat is widening a little bit. Things are, all the time, changing a little in one direction or the other. Ten years from now, you will see the difference. Our managers of the businesses we run, I have one message to them, and we want to widen the moat. We want to throw crocs, sharks and gatorsâI guessâinto the moat to keep away competitors. That comes about through service, through quality of product, it comes about through cost, some times through patents, and\/or real estate location. So that is the business I am looking for.\nNow what kind of businesses am I going to find like that? Well, I am going to find them in simple products because I am not going to be able to figure what the moat is going to look like for Oracle, Lotus or Microsoft, ten years from now. Gates is the best businessman I have ever run into and they have a hell of a position, but I really donât know what that business is going to look like ten years from now. I certainly donât know what his competitors will look like ten years from now. I know what the chewing business will look like ten years from now. The Internet is not going to change how we chew gum and nothing much else is going to change how we chew gum. There will lots of new products. Is Spearmint or Juicy Fruit going to evaporate? It isnât going to happen. You give me a billion dollars and tell me to go into the chewing gum business and try to make a real dent in Wrigleyâs. I canât do it. That is how I think about businesses. I say to myself, give me a billion dollars and how much can I hurt the guy? Give me $10 billion dollars and how much can I hurt Coca-Cola around the world? I canât do it. Those are good businesses.\nNow give me some money and tell me to hurt somebody in some other fields, and I can figure out how to do it.\nSo I want a simple business, easy to understand, great economics now, honest and able management, and then I can see about in a general way where they will be ten (10) years from now. If I canât see where they will be ten years from now, I donât want to buy it. Basically, I donât want to buy any stock where if they close the NYSE tomorrow for five years, I wonât be happy owning it. I buy a farm and I donât get a quote on it for five years and I am happy if the farm does OK. I buy an apartment house and donât get a quote on it for five years, I am happy if the apartment house produces the returns that I expect. People buy a stock and they look at the price next morning and they decide to see if they are doing well or not doing well. It is crazy. They are buying a piece of the business. That is what Grahamâthe most fundamental part of what he taught me.\nYou are not buying a stock, you are buying part ownership in a business. You will do well if the business does well, if you didnât pay a totally silly price. That is what it is all about. You ought to buy businesses you understand. Just like if you buy farms, you ought to buy farms you understand.\tIt is not complicated.\nIncidentally, by the way, in calling this Graham-Buffett, this is pure Graham. I was very fortunate. I picked up his book (The Intelligent Investor) when I was nineteen; I got interested in stocks when I was 6 or 7.\tI bought my first stock when I was eleven. But I was playing around with all this stuffâI had charts and volume and I was making all types of technical calculations and everything. Then I picked up a little book that said you are not just buying some little ticker symbol, that bounces around every day, you are buying part of a business. Soon as I started thinking about it that way, everything else followed. It is very simple. So we buy businesses we think we can understand. There is no one here who canât understand Coke.\nIf I was teaching a class at business school, on the final exam I would pass out the information on an Internet company and ask each student to value it. Anybody that gave me an answer, Iâd flunk (Laughter). I donât know how to do it. But people do it all the time; it is more exciting. If you look at it like you are going to the races--that is a different thing--but if you are investing.... Investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more back later at an appropriate rate. And to do that you have to understand what you are doing at any time. You have to understand the business. You can understand some businesses but not all businesses.\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What types of businesses have the highest ROIC? ->","completion":" WB: You could run Coca-Cola with no capital. There are a number of businesses that operate on negative capital. Great magazines operate with negative capital. Subscriptions are paid upfront, they have limited fixed investments. There are certain businesses like this. Blue Chip Stamps - it got float ahead of time. There are a lot of great businesses. Apple doesnât need very much capital. Seeâs needs little capital but it canât get that large -- we canât get people eating 10 lbs of boxed chocolate every day. Great consumer businesses need relatively little capital. Where people pay you in advance (magazines, insurance), you are using your customersâ capital. But the rest of the world knows this and they get expensive. It can be competitive to buy them. Business Wire â it doesnât require capital. Many service businesses require little capital. When successful, they can be something.\nCM: Nothing to add, the formula never changes.\nWB: If you could own one business in the world, what would it be?\nCM: You and I got in trouble many decades ago for this, naming the most fabulous business.

{"prompt":"What businesses should we avoid? ->","completion":" In the textile industry, we always had new machinery that held the promise of increasing our profit, but it never did because everyone else bought the same machinery.  It was sort of like being in a crowd, and everyone stands on tip-toes â your view doesnât improve, but your legs hurt.\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What have been your business mistakes? ->","completion":" How much time do you have? The interesting thing about investments for me and my partner, Charlie Munger, the biggest mistakes have not been mistakes of commission, but of omission. They are where we knew enough about the business to do something and where, for one reason or another, sat they're sucking out thumbs instead of doing something. And so we have passed up things where we could have made billions and billions of dollars from things we understood, forget about things we donât understand. The fact I could have made billions of dollars from Microsoft doesnât mean anything because I never could understand Microsoft. But if I can make billions out of healthcare stocks, then I should make it. And I didnât when the Clinton health care program was proposed and they all went in the tank. We should have made a ton of money out of that because I could understand it. And didnât make it.\nI should have made a ton of money out of Fannie Mae back the mid-1980s, but I didnât do it. Those are billion dollar mistakes or multi-billion dollar mistakes that generally accepted accounting principles donât pick up. The mistakes you see. I made a mistake when I bought US Air Preferred some years ago. I had a lot of money around. I make mistakes when I get cash. Charlie tells me to go to a bar instead. Donât hang around the office. But I hang around the office and I have money in my pocket, I do something dumb. It happens every time. So I bought this thing. Nobody made me buy it. I now have an 800 number I call every time I think about buying a stock in an airline. I say, âI am Warren and I am an air-aholic.â They try to talk me down, âKeep talking donât do anything rash.â Finally I got over it. But I bought it. And it looked like we would lose all our money in it. And we came very close to losing all our money in it.\tYou can say we deserved to lose our money it.\nWe bought it because it was an attractive security. But it was not in an attractive industry. I did the same thing in Salomon. I bought an attractive security in a business I wouldnât have bought the equity in. So you could say that is one form of mistake. Buying something because you like the terms, but you donât like the business that well. I have done that in the past and will probably do that again. The bigger mistakes are the ones of omission. Back when I had $10,000 I put $2,000 of it into a Sinclair Service Station which I lost, so the opportunity cost on that money is about $6 billion right now--fairly big mistakes. It makes me feel good when my Berkshire goes down, because the cost of my Sinclair Station goes down too. My 20% opportunity cost. I will say this, it is better to learn from other peopleâs mistakes as much as possible. But we donât spend any time looking back at Berkshire. I have a partner, Charlie Munger; we have been pals for forty yearsânever had an argument. We disagree on things a lot but we donât have arguments about it.\nWe never look back. We just figure there is so much to look forward to that there is no sense thinking of what we might have done. It just doesnât make any difference. You can only live life forward. You can learn something perhaps from the mistakes, but the big thing to do is to stick with the businesses you understand. So if there is a generic mistake outside your circle of competence like buying something that somebody tips you on or something of the sort. In an area you know nothing about, you should learn something from that which is to stay with what you can figure out yourself. You really want your decision making to be by looking in the mirror. Saying to yourself, âI am buying 100 shares of General Motors at $55 because........â It is your responsibility if you are buying it. Thereâs gotta be a reason and if you canât state the reason, you shouldnât buy it. If it is because someone told you about it at a cocktail party, not good enough.\tIt canât be because of the volume or a reason like the chart looks good. It has to be a reason to buy the business. That we stick to pretty carefully. That is one of the things Ben Graham taught me.\n\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you determine what is the proper price to pay for the business? ->","completion":" It is a tough thing to decide but I donât want to buy into any business I am not terribly sure of. So if I am terribly sure of it, it probably wonât offer incredible returns. Why should something that is essentially a cinch to do well, offer you 40% a year? We donât have huge returns in mind, but we do have in mind not losing anything. We bought Seeâs Candy in 1972, Seeâs Candy was then selling 16 m. pounds of candy at a $1.95 a pound and it was making 2 bits a pound or $4 million pre-tax. We paid $25 million for itâ6.25 x pretax or about 10x after tax. It took no capital to speak of. When we looked at that businessâbasically, my partner, Charlie, and Iâwe needed to decide if there was some untapped pricing power there. Where that $1.95 box of candy could sell for $2 to $2.25. If it could sell for $2.25 or another $0.30 per pound that was $4.8 on 16 million pounds. Which on a $25 million purchase price was fine. We never hired a consultant in our lives; our idea of consulting was to go out and buy a box of candy and eat it.\nWhat we did know was that they had share of mind in California. There was something special. Every person in Ca. has something in mind about Seeâs Candy and overwhelmingly it was favorable. They had taken a box on Valentineâs Day to some girl and she had kissed him. If she slapped him, we would have no business. As long as she kisses him, that is what we want in their minds. Seeâs Candy means getting kissed. If we can get that in the minds of people, we can raise prices. I bought it in 1972, and every year I have raised prices on Dec. 26th, the day after Christmas, because we sell a lot on Christmas. In fact, we will make $60 million this year. We will make $2 per pound on 30 million pounds. Same business, same formulas, same everything--$60 million bucks and it still doesnât take any capital.\nAnd we make more money 10 years from now. But of that $60 million, we make $55 million in the three weeks before Christmas. And our company song is: âWhat a friend we have in Jesus.â (Laughter). It is a good business. Think about it a little. Most people do not buy boxed chocolate to consume themselves, they buy them as giftsâ somebodyâs birthday or more likely it is a holiday. Valentineâs Day is the single biggest day of the year. Christmas is the biggest season by far. Women buy for Christmas and they plan ahead and buy over a two or three week period. Men buy on Valentineâs Day. They are driving home; we run ads on the Radio. Guilt, guilt, guiltâguys are veering off the highway right and left. They wonât dare go home without a box of Chocolates by the time we get through with them on our radio ads. So that Valentineâs Day is the biggest day.\nCan you imagine going home on Valentineâs Dayâour Seeâs Candy is now $11 a pound thanks to my brilliance. And letâs say there is candy available at $6 a pound. Do you really want to walk in on Valentineâs Day and handâshe has all these positive images of Seeâs Candy over the yearsâand say, âHoney, this year I took the low bid.â And hand her a box of candy. It just isnât going to work. So in a sense, there is untapped pricing powerâit is not price dependent.\nThink of Disney. Disney is selling Home Videos for $16.95 or $18.95 or whatever. All over the worldâpeople, and we will speak particularly about Mothers in this case, have something in their mind about Disney. Everyone in this room, when you say Disney, has something in their mind about Disney. When I say Universal Pictures, if I say 20th Century Fox, you donât have anything special in your mind. Now if I say Disney, you have something special in your mind. That is true around the world.\nNow picture yourself with a couple of young kids, whom you want to put away for a couple of hours every day and get some peace of mind. You know if you get one video, they will watch it twenty times. So you go to the video store or wherever to buy the video. Are you going to sit there and premier 10 different videos and watch them each for an hour and a half to decide which one your kid should watch? No. Letâs say there is one there for $16.95 and the Disney one for $17.95âyou know if you take the Disney video that you are going to be OK. So you buy it. You donât have to make a quality decision on something you donât want to spend the time to do. So you can get a little bit more money if you are Disney and you will sell a lot more videos. It makes it a wonderful business. It makes it very tough for the other guy.\nHow would you try to create a brandâDreamworks is tryingâthat competes with Disney around the world and replaces the concept that people have in their minds about Disney with something that says, Universal Pictures? So a mother is going to walk in and pick out a Universal Pictures video in preference to a Disney. It is not going to happen.\nCoca-Cola is associated with people being happy around the world. Everyplace â Disneyland, the World Cup, the Olympicsâwhere people are happy. Happiness and Coke go together. Now you give meâI donât care how much moneyâand tell me that I am going to do that with RC Cola around the world and have five billion people have a favorable image in their mind about RC Cola. You canât get it done. You can fool around, you can do what you want to do. You can have price discounts on weekends. But you are not going to touch it. That is what you want to have in a business. That is the moat. You want that moat to widen.\nIf you are Seeâs Candy, you want to do everything in the world to make sure that the experience basically of giving that gift leads to a favorable reaction. It means what is in the box, it means the person who sells it to you, because all of our business is done when we are terribly busy. People come in during theose weeks before Chirstmas, Valentineâs Day and there are long lines. So at five oâclock in the afternoon some woman is selling someone the last box candy and that person has been waiting in line for maybe 20 or 30 customers. And if the salesperson smiles at that last customer, our moat has widened and if she snarls at âem, our moat has narrowed. We canât see it, but it is going on everyday. But it is the key to it. It is the total part of the product delivery. It is having everything associated with it say, Seeâs Candy and something pleasant happening. That is what business is all about.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}

I asked him for examples of this [bad businesses turning into good businesses] over the past 100 years [and he couldn't name very many].\nSometimes businesses have problems, but haven't lost their competitive advantages. When GEICO had problems [in the mid-1970s], the model wasn't broken.\nOne example: Pepsi lost its edge post-WW II when costs went up, but they successfully changed. To some extent Gillette lost its competitive edge in the 1930s to penny blades, but then regained it.\nBut generally speaking, when a company loses its edge, it's very difficult to regain. Packard [cars] went downscale one year and never regained its upscale image. Department stores have done this. You can always juice sales by going down market, but it's hard to go back up market.\n"}

We are putting big money in big businesses with good economics, but not as good as when we were dealing with smaller amounts. $40m of capital required in Seeâs and it earns much more than that. If we could put in more we would. But wonderful businesses donât soak up capital â we had $2.2b operating earnings in Q1. We have to put it out as intelligently as we can. When we find them, weâll buy them. Can we put it to work intelligently? We think capital intensive businesses we have bought are good, working well. But it canât work brilliantly, we canât spend all that money and still get high returns. But does that mean we should pay out excess capital instead? No, because we think they can earn a good return even with the need to make capital investments in certain businesses. We are better paying it out only if we canât translate it into more than $1 of present value. In our judgment with BNSF we did it, but scorecard will only come in 10 to 20 yrs. In MidAmerican, we have done it. But it wonât be a Coca-Cola â which doesnât need as much capital. I hope we donât disappoint you.

What discount rates do you use? ->","completion":" We use a treasury rate for comparability across companies and time. As far as weÂâre concerned, a dollar earned by The Lucky Horseshoe Company is the same as a dollar earned by an Internet company - even if the market is a lot more enthusiastic about the Internet company dollar.\nValuation is an art. Look at Wrigley: pick a figure for what the volumes will be, their prices, their competition, the likelihood of management being bright with cash. All of that figures into the moat and its size, and what that business will earn.\nThere arenÂât many businesses with a terrific moat. Coke has a terrific moat, right down to the container. How many other products can people identify correctly when theyÂâre blindfolded? Coke has not just market share, it has a great share of mind. People associate Coke with good things. Ten years from now, the moat formed by that share of mind will be even greater.\nNo formula in finance tells you that the moat is 28 feet wide and 16 feet deep. ThatÂâs what drives the academics crazy. They can compute standard deviations and betas, but they canÂât understand moats. Maybe IÂâm being too hard on the academics.\n[CM: YouÂâre not sufficiently critical of the academics. They remind me of Long Term Capital Management - why do smart people do dumb things against their own self-interest?]\nNow we have whole finance departments full of destructive self-pity, which is one of the most dangerous forces in the world. And you are paying to send your children to those schools!\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Not too long ago, a reasonable person might have concluded that Kellogg and Campbell Soup had big moats around their businesses, but that has proven not to be the case and their stocks have languished. What might we learn from this?  ->","completion":" I'm not an expert on these companies, but my understanding is that Kellogg pushed their pricing too far. They didn't have to moat they thought they had versus General Mills and other major competitors. Campbell's problems are more related to lifestyle changes of Americans. Soup fits in a little less well than it did 40 years ago.\nWith soft drinks, there has been no decrease in demand for decades. 30% of liquid consumption of Americans is soda and 40% of that is Coke products, so 1\/8th of U.S. liquid consumption is Coke products.\nCoffee and milk consumption has been declining every year -- it's clear where preferences go once people start drinking soda.\nThese trends are almost impossible not to happen in developing countries, where the consumption of Coke products is 1\/50th what it is in the U.S. -- though Coke could screw it up by pricing too high.\nCoke has also benefited from its relative price. Since 1930, its cost per ounce has only doubled. This very low price inflation has contributed to the increase in per capita consumption.\n[Munger: \"Kellogg's and Campbell's moats have also shrunk due to the increased buying power of supermarkets and companies like Wal-Mart. The muscle power of Wal-Mart and Costco has increased dramatically.\"]\nThere is always a battle between the retailers and manufacturers of branded products. In the 1930s, A&P had its own line of branded products that did very well. It would be interesting to know what happened.\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What's your opinion of downsizing and outsourcing? ->","completion":" Whether or not such actions are necessary depends on the industry: if itÂâs a growing industry, you donÂât need such measures. If thereÂâs not enough growth in an industry to support all of the players, itÂâs in societyÂâs best interests to have the most output produced with the least inputs - but society needs to help those who find themselves on the outside. ÂâI believe this has been more of a media story than a real news story,Ââ Buffett explained. ÂâI donÂât believe thereÂâs a greater percentage of people displaced as a percentage of the work force than there was ten years ago.Ââ \nMungerÂâs take on the situation: ÂâI canÂât name a firm that was harmed by over-downsizing. I can rattle off name after name of ones that were ruined by bloat. ItÂâs fashionable to say downsizing is wrong: I think itÂâs wrong that the firms got in such a state that they needed downsizing.Â\n\t\t\t\t\n"}
